<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>We tried this restaurant out yesterday after mistakenly going to five guys burgers the week before which i may add was also a pleasant surprise. 
This restaurant was awesome. We were seated upon arrival and provided with two glasses of ice water and a bottle to refill our water if needed. The waiter was very attentive and answered every question we had.  We both ordered the burger of the month, the name escapes me. I have to tell you this was one of the most tasty burgers i have ever had and it held together well even with two 4oz patties.  The onion rings were also very good and served in a mini basket with a handle.  The decor of the restaurant was rather bland but i dont go out to eat to admire the decor of a restaurant. 
If you want a good restaurant experience with very friendly staff I highly recommend this place.  One last thing. They do have more than just burgers on the menu.

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>the last time i came here, the food was "off" - not spoiled or inedible but lacking taste and texture. i got a to-go container of food from their buffet for a late lunch...a variety of different offerings from a chicken-based dish to a couple of vegetarian items (lentils and cauliflower). the flavor was so-so and the texture of the lentils and the chicken was rather "soupy." i'm used to thicker sauces when i get indian food and was underwhelmed when i ended up with a pool of thin sauce underneath my rice.

i'm rather surprised that this restaurant has the same "star" rating at the indian restaurant on south st near 16th. the latter is upscale and amazingly delicious while this place is on the cheaper end of quality and taste.

<|endoftext|>I lived in South Korea for 3 years and this restaurant food was over priced with horrible sides. The Kimchi was dry and a bottle of soju was $15.00.  The potato salad was bland with no taste.  The decor is beautiful, but if you want  good authentic Korean food, go to Gogi Korean restaurant.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>The restaurant is in the middle of the Italian Market on ninth st. The restaurant is old school, red sauce place.  If that's the type of place your looking for it's ok.  But if your looking for something more lighter, clean flavored Italian this is not your place.  It's busy and on the smaller side.

<|endoftext|>This restaurant is not like what it used to when I visited two years ago.

I am not sure what the hype is all about...maybe it's for the different Han Dynasty, but the food is not good...this could explain why they couldn't get another Zagat rating.

We ordered the beef noodle soup and it was blend.  The favour of the soup didn't have enough time to penetrate the noodle, so it tasted like noodle-and-soup, not noodle soup.  If you go down the block to visit Z-wei and have their chilli beef noodle soup, you'll know what I am talking about.

We also had the scallion pancake, but it was bit over-fried, so we could taste the bitterness.

The string bean dish is the only dish that is still up to par.

As for atmosphere, the restaurant needs a serious rework.  The restaurant is dark and gloomy, but the decor wasn't going to the trendy theme.  The benches all have holes on them.  The feel of the restaurant is that it's cheap and rundown....

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>We tried this restaurant out yesterday after mistakenly going to five guys burgers the week before which i may add was also a pleasant surprise. 
This restaurant was awesome. We were seated upon arrival and provided with two glasses of ice water and a bottle to refill our water if needed. The waiter was very attentive and answered every question we had.  We both ordered the burger of the month, the name escapes me. I have to tell you this was one of the most tasty burgers i have ever had and it held together well even with two 4oz patties.  The onion rings were also very good and served in a mini basket with a handle.  The decor of the restaurant was rather bland but i dont go out to eat to admire the decor of a restaurant. 
If you want a good restaurant experience with very friendly staff I highly recommend this place.  One last thing. They do have more than just burgers on the menu.

<|endoftext|>I just moved 4000 miles across the country American Idol I was brought out to this restaurant told it was very good and the employees were very nice let me sit down the general manager named Jimmy James when he answers the phone again and tries to fake you out. I had had a long day and a bad experience with another restaurant when he approached the table he looked at me and said sorry if you got a problem today but it's not my problem then he took the drinks that were set on our table and said get out I have never in my life in any part of this country ever seen a general manager be able to tell you to get out just because he doesn't want you to be at the restaurant it was a very personal arrogant decision I'm sorry that that man doesn't like gay people but the way we were treated is very disrespectful I had my service dog with me and he disrespected my service dog as well then when I tried to call back to speak to the owner or manager he said he was the manager but his name was James this time then when I asked if I could talk to an owner he said try to figure out who it is I said could you please tell me the name of your owner he said nope figure it out for yourself this is the most unorthodox crazy behavior that I've ever seen in my life for restaurant management I have been a general manager in the restaurant industry for quite some time this is my thirtieth year in the industry and I have never in my life experience someone to be able to treat people this way and then just disregard you I urge anyone who ever considers to go to this restaurant to never go to this restaurant it's one of the most disrespectful arrogant  places I've ever been to. The general manager's job is to make sure people are satisfied and happy with the experience if they come into your restaurant and to treat me like I shouldn't even be in your restaurant or should not have even come up to talk to you is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever experienced in my life I hope the owner knows what you're doing and I hope they know it soon so they don't get put out of business because you're an idiot

<|endoftext|>The Traditional American Restaurant 
It is hard to say "No" to this particular American restaurant. Last time I went there on Nov. 21. 2014 with a couple of my friends who have studied in USA 5 years. The reason that I could even remember the exactly date was because everything was perfect here! Texas roadhouse is located at 1545 Street Road Bensalem (powelton village). I think you may need a car when you want to get there, or there is also a train station near the restaurant. 

Food
The waitress brought the free bread with hot butter and peanut for us. This was the best bread I ever had. I would highly recommend that you try Bone-in Ribeye, which is a 20 oz. hand cut steak. At the same time, they would offer two sides for free that you could choose. I ordered a butter corn, and a sweet potato for the two sides. Medium-well was the best choice for me, and I also liked the gravy with the mushroom and onion. I also recommended that you try New York Strip because this particular steak has 12 and 16 oz. size. It is a better choice for people who do not want to gain too much weight. The prices of those steaks are very reasonable; it depends on the steak's size. To be honest, the price of steak is not too expensive; the average is $25 per person. Likewise, I would like to recommend one antipasto for you, which is the honey shrimp. I still cannot forget that taste. On the other hand, they also offer the special food for children.

Service
The waiters and waitress were very friendly. I asked them for a small painting book when I was waiting for the food, even though they already had very fast speed to cook my dishes. They were enthusiastic to their works. Last time I went there, all waiters and waitress were singing the "Happy Birthday" to a person who sat near my table. They were also very patient; you could ask them refill your drinks and bread many time as you need, and they smiled to you all the time. I would like to give five stars on the service part!

Atmosphere
First of all, the washroom is extremely clean! The area of this restaurant is large, but you will not feel embarrassed cause there is no sound. The red soft light is around the restaurant with country music. When I came here, I felt that I came into a crow-boy's restaurant in the desert. You would feel relaxed because the atmosphere is so warm and sweet. If you do not like food here, you still can eat more because the atmosphere does not let you down! You can join the conversation with your friends easily because everyone comes here would chat to each other and laughing. There are lots of televisions in every single corner that you can watch the sports and news.

<|endoftext|>This train station is absolutely adorable! The architecture is classic, and the ceilings are high! 

I don't know why this place has some terrible ratings from other reviewers. They offer ample seating for you to wait for your train, and there are plenty of food options here. Granted it's nothing too exciting, but what do you expect? There's a Wendy's, Jersey Mike's, Auntie Anne's, a few coffee shops/cafes, and other small name food places. They also have the cutest little flower stand at one end of the station. 

I docked off one star because the employees here don't seem to love their job, but I don't think I've ever met a train station employee who was excited to be working. Although they aren't the happiest, they are helpful if you have questions. 

Getting in line for your train can be a little hectic if you are confused about the train system, but once you get used to it, you'll realize this place is a gem to be at and take in!

Getting in line for your train can be a little hectic if you are confused about the train system, but once you get used to it, you'll realize this place is a gem to be at and take in!

I don't know why this place has some terrible ratings from other reviewers. They offer ample seating for you to wait for your train, and there are plenty of food options here. Granted it's nothing too exciting, but what do you expect? There's a Wendy's, Jersey Mike's, Auntie Anne's, a few coffee shops/cafes, and other small name food places. They also have the cutest little flower stand at one end of the station.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>If you are looking for something convent to the airport at a reasonable price this is a good choice.  This hotel is within walking distance of the airport, although it would be a difficult walk since it more or less involves walking in the street. They have a 24hr shuttle van that you can request instead. 

The rooms are not to bad, they are clean enough, the beds are okay as well, and the hotel as a room that they call a fitness room. They also have a pool to relax at after a flight. I found the service to be  good and everyone friendly enough. 

On the downside is the lack of food choices. They have a Denny's, which tastes like every other Denny's. If you are staying here and looking for food, I would recommend walking next door to the Hilton (which is where I will probably stay next time) and eating in one of the restaurants there. 

Also keep in mind, it is across the street from the airport, so expect to hear planes all night, as well as an occasional train that runs along the backside of the hotel.

<|endoftext|>Excellent hotel with friendly staff and well appointed (especially for the train enthusiast) and spacious rooms. The hotel is connected to the old train station (rooms are in new wings but hotel amenities are in the restored section) which part of it has been turned into the hotel while the backside is a boardwalk with a couple of restaurants and a spectacular fire and light show (not sure if this is all year round or just during the holidays). In addition to the fire and light show on the backside of the hotel, the grand lobby has an awesome projection show with music that happens several times a day and is projected on the 100 yard long curved ceiling. 

Our package included breakfast which was an excellent buffet with a variety of pastries and fresh fruits, omelet station, fresh waffles and pancakes. The parking was an additional $27 which was a bit steep and is on a surface lot across a non-busy street from the hotel with a 24hr attendant. If you're hilton gold status or higher, they have a lounge that has breakfast in the morning and appetizers in the evening at no cost.    

The location is convenient and it's a really great experience with the different shows that are offered. Additionally the staff was very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is connected to the old train station (rooms are in new wings but hotel amenities are in the restored section) which part of it has been turned into the hotel while the backside is a boardwalk with a couple of restaurants and a spectacular fire and light show (not sure if this is all year round or just during the holidays). In addition to the fire and light show on the backside of the hotel, the grand lobby has an awesome projection show with music that happens several times a day and is projected on the 100 yard long curved ceiling. 

Our package included breakfast which was an excellent buffet with a variety of pastries and fresh fruits, omelet station, fresh waffles and pancakes. The parking was an additional $27 which was a bit steep and is on a surface lot across a non-busy street from the hotel with a 24hr attendant. If you're hilton gold status or higher, they have a lounge that has breakfast in the morning and appetizers in the evening at no cost.    

The location is convenient and it's a really great experience with the different shows that are offered. Additionally the staff was very friendly and helpful.

<|endoftext|>After a completely miserable travel experience, I walked into my hotel room at the Independent....and let out a sigh of relief.

Have you ever walked into a hotel room and just kind of felt blah? Or "ugh"? Well not here. Yes, the rooms are small and cozy, but they have a terrific feeling to them. I was so happy staying here and if I come back, I would never stay anywhere else.

First, I got a great deal on this hotel through Expeda; so if you can, check there first for a discount.

Second, the staff were all incredibly nice. Because there are not many rooms, they know who everyone is and will usually greet you by name. There is no restaurant in the hotel but it doesn't matter because there are a ton of places to eat.  

Here is my list of plusses:
-Great location.  Near train stops and in a great part of town that feels safe
-Tons of restaurants within a 5 minute walk
-Down the street from Thomas Jefferson University and Medical Center
-Free continental breakfast that includes yogurt, fruit, cereal/muffin/granola bar that is perfect to take with you for a snack as you explore the city
-SUPREMELY comfy beds
-Great iron with full ironing board and hairdryer
-DirecTV with a ton of channels
-Good in-room climate control
-Wine and cheese in the lobby

The only minus for me was that the shower was really small. The water pressure was fantastic and the temperature was spot on, but it was a little hard to shave my legs; I felt like i was on a cruise ship.  But knowing that in advance, I will be mentally prepared next time.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>By far the worst hotel experience of my life.  The reservations staff makes promises that the front desk are not able/willing to keep, and you are left without the room you expected.  This morning the fire alarm went off in the hallway - the cleaning staff out in the hall had no idea what was going on, but said that if it was a drill, an announcement would have come over the loudspeaker.  I'm on the 15th floor, elevators disabled.  Called down to the front desk, only to be put on hold.  Several other hotel guests were in the hall trying to figure out what to do.  Once the alarm was off and the elevator was working I went down to the front desk and was told that "they" were checking and working on the elevators and alarms, and that this would be happening all day.  There WAS a sign on the 1st floor about this, but absolutely NO NOTIFICATION to any of the guests on the upper floors.  At least not to the half dozen or so people I spoke to.  I told the manager that she had many terrified people up there, and that the hotel should have made an effort to notify their guests - push a note under the room door, leave a phone message, or at least inform the cleaning staff so they could pass the word along.  I told her that I would leave the hotel if I could, but that I had one more day there.  She offered to cancel my stay so I could leave early.  WOW....what a way to handle a disgruntled guest who has a bill of over $2000 at your hotel.  To not keep reservation promises and not care about how it inconveniences your guests is one thing, but to not care about their safety, and leave them terrified...that's a totally different thing.  I will never stay at this hotel or any of the other hotels/resorts run by the Summit Group.

They don't cut you a break at all. They penny pinch you for everything.  It will be a lost battle trying to talk to Travelocity. Please do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. Plenty of hotels to choose from around the area.  I paid $350 per night with Travelocity and the hotel website stated $159 per night for 4 people. No refund from Travelocity.

It was always nice coming back to the room since it was soo hot and humid outside. I liked how the hotel was very efficient with water conservation as well. It's perfect distance to walk to any tourist attraction or the local hang out spots. Truly a treasure in the city of New Orleans for a hotel!

<|endoftext|>We stayed because of a conference held in the hotel and we won't stay again.  We requested a room with a king size bed and upon checking in we were told that there are none and we would be staying in a double bed room for all four nights of our stay.   We were put in a room right next to the elevator, across from the ice machine with a window view of a wall.  We are staying at the hotel for four nights and we made the reservation directly on the hotel web site - so no discounts.  The hotel charges an $18 resort fee per day (not sure what that is for) and a $22 parking fee.  They charge for transportation to and from the airport $30 each way.  Today I went to buy a pack of gum in the Cascade gift shop and was charged $2.88.  The hotel is about a 25 minute drive into downtown and a $25 cab ride - so if you do stay - you are a captive audience and they will nickel and dime you to death.  And oh - this place is freezing!  They blast the air conditioning - and I froze to death (and I live in Minnesota).  Finally - the water tastes like a swimming pool so you can't really drink it out of the tap.  On the plus side, housekeeping is great, the hotel supplies you with two "complimentary" 16 oz bottles of water (this must be what the $18 resort fee covers) the place is also clean.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and don't stay here if you don't have to.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>The Praline Connection makes a mean po' boy.  The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.  I was looking forward to trying out their fried oyster po' boy, but unfortunately, the restaurant was out of oysters.  They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.

I subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.

Small note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.  How are you just going to leave incorrect pricing in your menu (50 cents isn't a lot, but it's the principle)?

We were told by our waitress to try their fried chicken next time.  The waiters and waitresses are dressed in white dress shirts and black slacks with black top hats and suspenders.  The floor is tiled in black and white tiles.  The restaurant is connected to a small praline/candy shop where you can buy fresh daily-made pralines.  The pralines are about $2 apiece.  I bought a few of the original on my way out and they were pretty good.  Super sugary for sure.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>The food is good the service is terrible i went there about 3 times with my cousins and the people workin there were on the phones or talking to the other employees i didn't know if i should go and pour myself a refill or ask the waitress that was working at the time for a refill she took forever to come and check up on us and i would understand if it was busy but me and my family were the only ones in the restaurant and i think i understand know why were the only ones in that place i thought i came in to dine in not to get up and refill my drink myself if i wanted to get up and refill my own drink i would have went to McDonald's is this place a fast food place or a dine in restaurant and truly believe McDonald's has better service. Only thing that's holding me back from going there again is the service it's sad to say

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>Fun place to hang out, order mezes (greek tapas) and share with your whole group.  Colorfully decorated and it seemed like every table in the place was a good place to eat, there are four different atmospheres throughout the restaurant in this small space.  If you have a big group or request you can sit in booths with airy curtains curtains and cushions.
The staff is friendly and the food is yummy!

<|endoftext|>I just moved 4000 miles across the country American Idol I was brought out to this restaurant told it was very good and the employees were very nice let me sit down the general manager named Jimmy James when he answers the phone again and tries to fake you out. I had had a long day and a bad experience with another restaurant when he approached the table he looked at me and said sorry if you got a problem today but it's not my problem then he took the drinks that were set on our table and said get out I have never in my life in any part of this country ever seen a general manager be able to tell you to get out just because he doesn't want you to be at the restaurant it was a very personal arrogant decision I'm sorry that that man doesn't like gay people but the way we were treated is very disrespectful I had my service dog with me and he disrespected my service dog as well then when I tried to call back to speak to the owner or manager he said he was the manager but his name was James this time then when I asked if I could talk to an owner he said try to figure out who it is I said could you please tell me the name of your owner he said nope figure it out for yourself this is the most unorthodox crazy behavior that I've ever seen in my life for restaurant management I have been a general manager in the restaurant industry for quite some time this is my thirtieth year in the industry and I have never in my life experience someone to be able to treat people this way and then just disregard you I urge anyone who ever considers to go to this restaurant to never go to this restaurant it's one of the most disrespectful arrogant  places I've ever been to. The general manager's job is to make sure people are satisfied and happy with the experience if they come into your restaurant and to treat me like I shouldn't even be in your restaurant or should not have even come up to talk to you is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever experienced in my life I hope the owner knows what you're doing and I hope they know it soon so they don't get put out of business because you're an idiot

<|endoftext|>Maybe your best choice for a hotel stay in the Tampa area.  In general I like the boutique hotel branch of the Sheraton family of hotels, but this one has the winning trifecta of location, staff and relative price.  Even when a bowl game is coming up there's a good choice of mid priced hotel options in Tampa (still, of course book as far in advance as you can), if you're anchoring your plans around Raymand James Stadium your best choices are around the airport or downtown.  Having tried both, I think you end up better off downtown so you're closer to other fun stuff to do than being in the airport area.  In the downtown area, there are a number of hotel choices hovering between $100 to $160 a night (depending on how fast you book when they announce the Outback Bowl teams), with Aloft being about midrange.  However, they didn't charge me more for the king size bed, and we didn't experience any of the usual noise problems New Year's Eve (in spite of the party at the bar).  
    The Aloft Tampa Downtown is in a great location, you can take the number 30 HART bus right from the airport (Red Terminal, just outside of the Southwest Airlines baggage claim area) to across the street from this hotel (on the bridge) for only $2.  They don't know about public transportation in the hotel, use Google Maps.  Although Lyft was never more than 5 minutes away from here, for the most part we were able to easily use public transportation, a short and nice walk away is the downtown streetcar terminal which is a fun and cheap way to get to and from the aquarium and Ybor City.  The hotel is right on the Tampa Riverwalk, which is wonderful day, night but especially sunset.  I'm sure the Riverwalk is also nice for sunrise but that's just not in my wheelhouse.  Within two blocks are four good breakfast choices (and one terrible one), a good French restaurant, a CVS, a taco-bus, and just over the bridge is the interesting Plant museum and gardens.  Very close to the University of Tampa (from where Chyna graduated).
   The hotel is very attractive in terms of interior design, the theme is hi-fi audiophile, 1970s mod, it's clean and modern.  The staff is friendly and generally very accommodating, though they aren't that helpful in terms of local information (no hotel workers are nowadays). I found the hallways confusing (round, circular), but I also found the bar friendly and inviting so the two may be connected in some way.  The bartenders are skillful and interesting, there are no hidden up-charges just because you order rocks or neat, there's an adequate selection of good whiskey and they mix an excellent mojito (maybe a local requirement?).  Our room didn't have a great view (mostly the hotel wall next door) but the pool/lounge/sundeck has an excellent view.  That deck is a very nice place to hang out.  There's an excellent work out room that faces the river, marred somewhat by the choice of music (disco-remix) with high quality step, treadmill and exercise-cycle machines.  
    The rooms are very comfortable, nice roomy showers with great ventilation in the bathrooms, lots of electrical outlets, comfortable pillowtop beds, excellent housekeeping staff.  Minor complaint, not enough hooks or places to hang towels and clothes, no drawers for clothes.  The workstation/desk is a little stingy but there are two functional desktop computers for guest use attached to a printer.  WiFi was good, free.  If you're booking for under $100 a night, I'd say this is a 5 star choice.

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>After moving to Indy from Chicago I was in search of a place for business lunches that could compare to the Chicago scene.  Unfortunately, because I work on the north side, all restaurant options downtown are were of the question.

I found Oakleys Bistro on Yelp and thought I would give it a try.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The service is fantastic and there are a lot of options on the lunch menu.  It was a great environment for a business lunch and very easy to get to (right off of 86th).

I highly recommend coming here for a classy business lunch if you're on the north side of town!

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>I have been to just about every Haunted House on the east coast in the past 25 years so I feel i am very qualified to review these attractions. I will review all that i have been to so look for my reviews everywhere. I plan my OCT each year around haunted Houses. I am very fair in my reviews as well and feel they are accurate. This review is for VALLEY OF FEAR. Since i go to so many houses my expectations were very low for this one. Not much press on it and had not heard to much about it. The lady on the phone told me that the "Actors" were the best part. I must say i agree. The people that work there did a superb job at "being the part" The hay ride was very cool but my biggest complaint for every single attraction here was that they were all just way way way too short. The hayride was about 15 min, and the first zombie house was literally about 6 min in and out. The last one was maybe 10 min. We went as slow as we could and it still under 30 min to go through all 3. Not very many props or animatronics but the couple they had I thought were fairly good. I would say if this attraction continues to grow it could be very good in the coming years but i would not drive more than an hour to go to this place. Pretty fun but not enough to justify a long trip. Look for my other reviews.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

definite things i would recommend:  Filet and shrimp with the famous fried rice (their secret is that they steam it in butter and chicken broth) and from the sushi bar, i would recommend the house somethings fishy roll... a good combination of fresh seafood and fried tempura

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>If you like Mexican food, this little gem is a must.  There's nothing totally spectacular about this restaurant, they just do a lot of things right.  The service is quick, the food is reasonable and the taste is spot on.  They have outdoor dining, but don't eat there if outdoor ambiance is what you're looking for.  It's really more utilitarian than anything else.  Not much in the way of décor.  The inside of the restaurant is clean, but dated.  Nothing wrong with that.  It's not upscale, just a family restaurant that makes good food.

You really couldn't ask for more in regards to value.  The price is really low and the servings are large.  I honestly don't think you could get this much food, for this price, at Taco Bell.  And this is real authentic Mexican food, not TexMex.

I'll eat here again.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>We all know that textbooks are ridiculously overpriced. That is just the way of the world. Paying an arm and a leg for a product that you absolutely despise gives you a gut wrenching feeling, but we have to do it.  It inst the fault of the people here at Textbook Brokers. 

Places like this get a bad rep, mostly because people are jealous of their business plan. They rent or sell you a book for almost retail price. Later they buy back the book for pennies on the dollar and then resale again at the original price. Genius! if you are the business owner. Hopefully one day I can come up with something as profitable. Unfortunately, for the student who has already spent every last dime they had on classes, it seems criminal.

After having spent hundreds of dollars on books that were unnecessary for the course because they were listed as "mandatory,"  I have learned a valuable lesson. Wait until after your first day class to buy the books. The syllabus will help you determine how "mandatory" the reading material really is. No more wasted money and books collecting dust. Your welcome.

One of my favorite things about renting books from Textbook Brokers is that they are normally used. There is nothing better than opening up a used book and seeing that somebody else has already done half the work for you. Annotations, highlights, and commentary marked all over is well worth renting from here. I walk in and ask ask them for the most used book on the shelf. Tip number 2: Work smarter, not harder.

This place has been great for me. They always have whatever I need in stock and most the time its ready for immediate pickup. If they don't have what you need then they will ship it to you free of charge. The people working behind the counter are always friendly and helpful. If you are renting a book, they will send you text messages and emails to make sure you don't miss the return date. Interactions are quick and easy.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city.

<|endoftext|>I enjoy a good tea, especially when I am about to get on the train or a plane and know I will be dehydrated for awhile.  The 30th Street Train Station has a variety of options for tea and other drinks, but I think this Cosi rates. The service is always good, the staff really is friendly and quick to serve (they realize, I think, that most of us are running for the train and time is of the essence), and they accommodate your desires.  I was able to buy a large sized tea with one tea bag and a little soy on the side. Now that is not something I can do at just any tea or coffee shop.  

I will continue to use Cosi when I am travelling through the train station!

<|endoftext|>If you are looking for something convent to the airport at a reasonable price this is a good choice.  This hotel is within walking distance of the airport, although it would be a difficult walk since it more or less involves walking in the street. They have a 24hr shuttle van that you can request instead. 

The rooms are not to bad, they are clean enough, the beds are okay as well, and the hotel as a room that they call a fitness room. They also have a pool to relax at after a flight. I found the service to be  good and everyone friendly enough. 

On the downside is the lack of food choices. They have a Denny's, which tastes like every other Denny's. If you are staying here and looking for food, I would recommend walking next door to the Hilton (which is where I will probably stay next time) and eating in one of the restaurants there. 

Also keep in mind, it is across the street from the airport, so expect to hear planes all night, as well as an occasional train that runs along the backside of the hotel.

<|endoftext|>Really really good crawfish!
I have been staying at the Crown Plaza one night every other month for the last year and a half and i just found out about this place :(
You can walk to it from the hotel, just be a little creative.

I ordered two pounds of crawfish and walked back to a open eating area at my hotel from there on it is all a blur...

SO GOOD!!!!!
I can't wait to come back, hopefully i will fly in early enough to order more off their menu.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Really really good crawfish!
I have been staying at the Crown Plaza one night every other month for the last year and a half and i just found out about this place :(
You can walk to it from the hotel, just be a little creative.

I ordered two pounds of crawfish and walked back to a open eating area at my hotel from there on it is all a blur...

SO GOOD!!!!!
I can't wait to come back, hopefully i will fly in early enough to order more off their menu.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This train station is absolutely adorable! The architecture is classic, and the ceilings are high! 

I don't know why this place has some terrible ratings from other reviewers. They offer ample seating for you to wait for your train, and there are plenty of food options here. Granted it's nothing too exciting, but what do you expect? There's a Wendy's, Jersey Mike's, Auntie Anne's, a few coffee shops/cafes, and other small name food places. They also have the cutest little flower stand at one end of the station. 

I docked off one star because the employees here don't seem to love their job, but I don't think I've ever met a train station employee who was excited to be working. Although they aren't the happiest, they are helpful if you have questions. 

Getting in line for your train can be a little hectic if you are confused about the train system, but once you get used to it, you'll realize this place is a gem to be at and take in!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>This hotel is located near the Tampa International airport.  I stayed here last week and have stayed here several times over the past 8 years.  This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  

Bad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. 

Good - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.

In summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.

<|endoftext|>Our family of four stayed two nights at the Palm Pavilion Inn a couple of weeks ago. This was our first stay at this hotel but after reading reviews, we had a good idea what to expect. First of all, this hotel is NOT a resort. It's an older, small, budget friendly, 3 story hotel that has been remodeled in a sort of funky, art-deco style and is an easy walk to the beach. 

Our room was small with two comfortable double beds but well appointed with flat screen tv, mini fridge and excellent wifi. The room is a little tight for four people but would be perfect for two. Coffee in the lobby. Friendly staff. Hotel furnishes beach towels and you can charge the beach chairs to the room. They even had some beach toys for our daughter to borrow.  I was told that for more money, the efficiency rooms are larger. 

We would definitely stay here again but would try out one of the larger rooms. If you're looking to stay at a chain type hotel or resort, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a small, family-owned, well appointed hotel, give Palm Pavilion.

<|endoftext|>I've stayed here countless times when I travel to Nashville for business.  I like how it's not too far from all the action, but still convenient to the downtown area and right near the highway.  I also love visiting the Gulch neighborhood so this location is perfect for that.  The hotel is also usually on the more budget-friendly end of the cost spectrum, which is great. One of my favorite bars is located just behind the hotel so it's a bonus to be able to visit every time I stay there. It's also near some great restaurant options, including the famous Hattie B's hot chicken. Front desk staff are friendly- free cookie bars are usually available during check-in hours in front of the little store area and you get a free GooGoo chocolate bar and Nashville postcard in your room. (Another freebie is bottled Dasani water upon check-in, if you are a Starwood member.) Expensive but convenient valet and self parking- valets are always very fast and friendly, unlike many of the other Nashville hotels. There's also a free shuttle bus that runs regularly between the hotel and downtown locations, and anywhere else you like within the city.  The rooms are standard, but they are clean and fairly spacious...mini-fridge and Keurig coffee maker are available in the room.  The only negative is that the hotel rate doesn't include a free breakfast, but hey, you're in Nashville...head to the Gulch for Biscuit Love! The hotel was recently renovated as well so it's pretty nice and comfortable.  Definitely one of my top choices whenever I stay in Nashville.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal.

It was extremely unorganized. Never have I seen a restaurant with a line trying to see a hostess. That's the point of the job, to take names and of how many people so they will inform you of when, where, and how long it will be til your sat. None of that here, it was a line of people looking and waiting for the next opportunity for a table comes up. Got so fed up with the disorganization and unprofessionalism we left. I'm sure the food is great, just get the front of the house straight

Service is excellent and the food is well worth the wait. Friendly waitress who gave good advice as we tried to decide between temptations. My soon is gluten free and they have a GF waffle that will make you slug yourself in the face with a bag of silver dollars and wood screws. Pro tip: Don't go if you're in a rush as it can take a bit for the food to arrive but you won't be disappointed. Will return!

<|endoftext|>Working for a teen camp, you have to find things for teenagers to do.  What better way to cool off than at a water park.  Add to it, a long bus ride on the hottest day of the summer (or so it would seem).

The park is located in Collinsville, and conveniently located near 55/70 and 255, so it is a bit of a drive, if you aren't from the area, but who doesn't like a road trip?

Splash City is open 11 am-7pm.  If you arrive after 4pm, you get $5 off your admission!  Prices start at $13 for children and $16 for adults.  These are for non Collinsville residents.  

Now for the attractions.  There is this wave machine called "Flow Rider" in which you get up on a surfboard.  That was way cool!  Monsoon Mountain is the bucket attraction that pours water on you, and there are water slides as well.  

They have concession if you get hungry and there is a store, in case you need a new swimsuit or more sunscreen.  

What better way to beat the heat!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>My coworkers and I needed to get a couple Ethernet adapters for their MacBook Airs so we grabbed a taxi to get to this mall. At the taxi driver's suggestion, we stopped here for some beignets on the way to the Apple store. I've never had beignets before and I'm SOOO glad this is where I had my first! They're like square doughnuts with a slightly yeastier, chewier texture. Yum-o. I still can't get over the fact that you can get 3 orders (with 3 beignets in each order) for less than $3.

This place is CASH only even though it is located in a mall, but it is affordable enough that the few dollars you can dig up in your wallet is probably sufficient.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Currently staying at this hotel for the CBI Conference. Nice hotel located in center city. The rooms are very spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. 

Be prepared to pay for parking which is common in this area. However, the parking garage for this hotel is slightly deceiving as the sign says "public parking" and then when you pull in it says no credit cards accepted. However, once you receive your ticket you take it to the check in counter and they bill the parking to your room. 

The conference rooms in which the event is being held in are standard but well kept and the food provided was quite good although the salmon was overcooked. 

Overall a good hotel to stay at if you're in the center city area.

If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic".

I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>I enjoy a good tea, especially when I am about to get on the train or a plane and know I will be dehydrated for awhile.  The 30th Street Train Station has a variety of options for tea and other drinks, but I think this Cosi rates. The service is always good, the staff really is friendly and quick to serve (they realize, I think, that most of us are running for the train and time is of the essence), and they accommodate your desires.  I was able to buy a large sized tea with one tea bag and a little soy on the side. Now that is not something I can do at just any tea or coffee shop.  

I will continue to use Cosi when I am travelling through the train station!

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>Hotel is clean and staff are very helpful. Although we don't have kids (yet, my wife is pregnant) I could see this being a great place to stay with the hotel having a nice pool, free hot breakfast, free parking and the hotel is near the zoo. Other reviews make it out that the hotel is near the metro link, which is not accurate. We used the metro link to go to the game and used the hotels free shuttle to take us to the station. If we would have walked from the hotel it would have been at least a 15 min walk. Price is ok, but not great. With taxes included we paid 194 per night. Oh and one other grip.. the bedding is not as comfortable as other hilton hotels. Overall a very good hotel. More for families than young couples.

Be prepared to pay for parking which is common in this area. However, the parking garage for this hotel is slightly deceiving as the sign says "public parking" and then when you pull in it says no credit cards accepted. However, once you receive your ticket you take it to the check in counter and they bill the parking to your room. 

The conference rooms in which the event is being held in are standard but well kept and the food provided was quite good although the salmon was overcooked. 

Overall a good hotel to stay at if you're in the center city area.

That would have been nice. I have visited this bar on one other occasion and had the mussels, and they were good.  Next time I will try to show up sooner. It's a nice bar/restaurant. While I am staying at the hotel this time, I didn't even know it was connected to a hotel last time. Not your average hotel lobby bar.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>If you are looking for something convent to the airport at a reasonable price this is a good choice.  This hotel is within walking distance of the airport, although it would be a difficult walk since it more or less involves walking in the street. They have a 24hr shuttle van that you can request instead. 

The rooms are not to bad, they are clean enough, the beds are okay as well, and the hotel as a room that they call a fitness room. They also have a pool to relax at after a flight. I found the service to be  good and everyone friendly enough. 

On the downside is the lack of food choices. They have a Denny's, which tastes like every other Denny's. If you are staying here and looking for food, I would recommend walking next door to the Hilton (which is where I will probably stay next time) and eating in one of the restaurants there. 

Also keep in mind, it is across the street from the airport, so expect to hear planes all night, as well as an occasional train that runs along the backside of the hotel.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>This is my first one star rating.  Cosi's at 30th Street Station is an AVOID.

I dashed in there at 4pm, hoping to eat something before 430pm train left the station -- since Amtrak has Sovietized the train food to the point that I couldn't bear one more micro-waved hot dog.

So out-witting Amtrak, I went to Cosi with a business colleague.  We had standard orders and got the number gizmos.  Wait, wait.  You wait here, I'll get some reading.  I have time to buy some newspapers, magazines, and come back.  Wait, wait.  The only ones with any urgency and me and my colleague.  4:20pm -- train's at Track 5.  Now it's 4:25pm -- gotta go -- train's here.  Finally, the first order appears and then mine.

And I ask one question is there plastic ware - knife, fork -- in the bag?  Oh yes the woman says authoritatively,,,, dash to the train.  No knife.  So I have to go to the Amtrak five-star dining car.... I had a Salad from Cosi that after two bits was inedible (Asian Chicken).  And the Bacon-Tomato-Chicken sandwich -- C-

This Cosi counts on the fact that if you have a complaint, you will be 30 miles from the Cosi before you discover you've been had.  The staff is indifferent to your train plight, and counts on the train to whisk away your complaint.  Avoid this Cosi.

Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>A pleasant train station.  Bigger than the ones I'm used to, but not quite as swanky as, say, Penn Station or Washington, DC's Union Station, the NOUPT is a comfortable place to wait for an upcoming train ride.

There's plenty of seating, a small lounge for sleeper car passengers, Subway subs, and pizza.  We bought an acceptably-priced deck of playing cards from an amusing gift shop that had all sorts of amusing hand-written notices from the management (e.g., "Nothing here is free.  Please don't ask.)

The folks at the ticket counter were friendly and helped us get up to speed with our first overnight train ride. This terminal made for a very pleasant start to our trip.

I lived overseas in college, and would eat authentic kebabs regularly, so I know what to expect.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>A nice and necessary museum.  I am grateful that Philadelphia has a plethora of attractions going back to a defining point in American history.  There is a lot that happened here, it is a pleasant experience.  If you are looking for a museum that has a lot of buttons and flashing lights, go to the Franklin Institute, this is not that type of museum.  If you are looking to stand in an historic place and soak in some information on the founding of this country, you have arrived.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>Anyone who says that this restaurant is "shockingly average" does not know anything about fine dining.  I have eaten in famous restaurants all over the world, and this one is right up there with any of them.  I will admit that if you are looking for a "scene" or a "trendy atmosphere", this restaurant is not for you.  However, having said that, I will say that there is no other restaurant in Philadelphia that produces food that is as interesting, fresh, and delicious as Marc Vetri's.  The service is impeccable, the menu ever-changing, and the preparations fascinatingly nuanced.

I went there tonight for my tenth time.  I took a few friends out for a celebratory dinner.  We ate their famous charcuterie plate, a special preparation of nantucket bay scallops, pig's foot ravioli, pork belly papardelle, spinach gnocci, shoulder of baby goat, salt-cured branzino, a cheese plate, lavender gelato, and chocolate souffle.  We ordered "family style" and enjoyed every single bite.  In fact, we ordered "seconds" of the papardelle and scallops because they were so delicious.

Some advice before dining at this restaurant.  First, eat family style.  It is the best way to taste as much as possible of the diverse menu.  Second, let them help you choose the wine.  The employees of this restaurant are well-versed in the nuances of their wine selections and will help you find a reasonably priced bottle that pairs well with your menu choices and preferences.  Third, when you eat here, "go all out".  That means, get ready to eat a lot, and prepare to enjoy yourself thoroughly.  This is a restaurant tailored for those who enjoy a cozy, comfortable atmosphere, nice people, and good food.  Again, if you are looking for a trendy restaurant, go to Morimoto.  The food won't be NEARLY as good, but you'll find all of the wannabe hipsters you can handle.

I know this is a strong review, but I believe every word of it.  There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Philadelphia that may enjoy more "street cred" (think Le Bec Fin, Morimoto, Buddhakan, etc.), but certainly do not deserve it.  This restaurant is absolutely terrific, and if you walk in with an open mind (and granted, an open wallet), you will absolutely enjoy it as much as I do.

Enjoy.  This will be one of your better dining experiences, anywhere.

<|endoftext|>From the outside it looks like this little old theatre even when you walk in to buy your tickets they have one booth with one rep. The whole place looks like you've walked into a theatre from the 1960's. They have 4 movies showing at a time. Once you walk into the actual theatre though it's a completely different story. It looks just like an AMC with the theatre still seating and large screen. The price is average for a ticket $11.50 if I was ever in the area again I would defiantly come back!

<|endoftext|>This is the best place to catch a movie in the week before it leaves the theatres. Never mind the hassle of navigating the cloverleaf from hell and the throng of screaming tweens who are just, like, so happy that Mom and Dad let them see a movie unsupervised and, summarily, have no idea how to behave (let's not talk about how my fiance and I recently went to see 'Gran Torino' and, upon leaving the theatre, were faced with dozens of Jonas Brothers-obsessed fangirls who didn't understand the concept of indoor voices). But none of that's not Loews' fault.

Like every other movie theatre, your wallet is going to feel ravaged in all the wrong ways by the time you've paid for your tickets and some snacks. But that's okay! The smaller theatres for last-chance-to-see-'em flicks are so cozy and clean and intimate, and the foods and snacks are some of the best in the area (second only to The Ritz in Voorhees). The staff is also surprisingly competent, which is a total bonus. 

Also? The comfiness of the theatre seats and the fact that they're able to recline a bit is deserving of its own paragraph. 

After years of the in-shambles Marlton AMC8 being my primary movie theatre, Loews is a wonderful upgrade. I'm eager to check out the still-relatively-new IMAX theatre they installed during the summer. I'm sure once I do, I'll bump this up to four stars.

<|endoftext|>Working for a teen camp, you have to find things for teenagers to do.  What better way to cool off than at a water park.  Add to it, a long bus ride on the hottest day of the summer (or so it would seem).

The park is located in Collinsville, and conveniently located near 55/70 and 255, so it is a bit of a drive, if you aren't from the area, but who doesn't like a road trip?

Splash City is open 11 am-7pm.  If you arrive after 4pm, you get $5 off your admission!  Prices start at $13 for children and $16 for adults.  These are for non Collinsville residents.  

Now for the attractions.  There is this wave machine called "Flow Rider" in which you get up on a surfboard.  That was way cool!  Monsoon Mountain is the bucket attraction that pours water on you, and there are water slides as well.  

They have concession if you get hungry and there is a store, in case you need a new swimsuit or more sunscreen.  

What better way to beat the heat!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.

I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

<|endoftext|>This is the worst corporate piece of shit hotel I have ever stayed in.  It has the same vibe as a Vegas hotel without the drinking or gambling.  Everything is overpriced and it is at least 30 minutes from the city.  DO NOT STAY HERE unless you are a dumbass and want to stay really far from the city and you don't want to experience a single thing that is Nashville.  Even when you try to go on your balcony you are still inside.  A cab to town costs $25.00 once way and there is no concierge.  You just need to escape and grab a cab.  They make every effort for you to stay and not leave.  It's the worst hotel on every level.  Oh.. I should explain the 1 star.  The room is really nice.  Doesn't matter when you are in corporate hell the second you step out of it and since you can't get fresh air you'll want to jump off your balcony since you're in a biodome and there is a roof everywhere.  Run.. run away!

If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>After hearing about FTS from some friends, we had to check it out. As we currently have two train enthusiasts in our midst, this was a home run!

Entering, you're greeted by a HUGE train set with all sorts of trains to play with. Naturally, our three year old gravitated towards the 3 engines another boy was playing with rather than the 50+ currently not in use. After a discussion about the importance of appropriate social conduct and the need for personal space, we proceeded to play for the next few hours on one of the four huge train tables. 

The walls are covered with just about any popular train toy your little, or you kiddo's little, heart may desire and is great place to stock up on birthday and Christmas gifts if the little ones are into this sort of things. Plenty of engines, tracks, cars as well as tons of books, puzzles and games made it a great spot to see what's available currently and get ideas of later in the year. 

Great place to come and spend a few hours on a rainy or nice day. Very nice folks running the place as well. Don't feel like standing? They've even got a bunch of seating for the adults while the little squirts run off some energy! A great place to check out for any and all train enthusiasts!

Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>Working for a teen camp, you have to find things for teenagers to do.  What better way to cool off than at a water park.  Add to it, a long bus ride on the hottest day of the summer (or so it would seem).

The park is located in Collinsville, and conveniently located near 55/70 and 255, so it is a bit of a drive, if you aren't from the area, but who doesn't like a road trip?

Splash City is open 11 am-7pm.  If you arrive after 4pm, you get $5 off your admission!  Prices start at $13 for children and $16 for adults.  These are for non Collinsville residents.  

Now for the attractions.  There is this wave machine called "Flow Rider" in which you get up on a surfboard.  That was way cool!  Monsoon Mountain is the bucket attraction that pours water on you, and there are water slides as well.  

They have concession if you get hungry and there is a store, in case you need a new swimsuit or more sunscreen.  

What better way to beat the heat!

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>The restaurant just reopened today from a 2 1/2 week renovation. The restaurant over went a complete transition. The look used to be casual dining with a very busy decor to a classy upscale looking restaurant. Don't worry about the prices, the restaurants is affordable. 

Great semi open kitchen so you can view the cooks in action. There is a glass to keep the noise from entering the dining room. 

Apps are around the $10 area and you can get many main course for $14 - $16. 

The food and service is top notch. There are many dishes to choose from. This has now become my wife and I favourite Italian restaurant in this price range. 

The reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because they spent the money on renovating the restaurant but our bread came in a broken wicker basket. One of our menus was very worn out around the edges. Not a big deal but don't cheap out on the little things.

<|endoftext|>i have been here at least 6 times now and tried probably 60-70% of the items on the menu. I love tapas and have been waiting for a good tapas place in Nashville for a long time. My favorite items on the menu are the brussel spriouts, spicy couliflower, steak tacos and fish tacos. 

One of the things i appreciate is that they have tapas portions but also entre sized portions which makes it a great place for lunch as well.

Location of the restaurant and the parking lot behind the restaurant are also very convenient. 

Overall, I really love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for tapas in Nashville.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

However, it was a bit dirty, and housekeeping did not refresh any soap, towels, coffee or shampoo unless you called down to request it (which we had to do every day).  Still, they were nice about it, and the hotel has a lot of great conveniences.  Excellent gym if your'e into that.  Overall, it wasn't the best hotel but it was still a pretty good experience.

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>I stayed here for one night in July and when I booked the hotel for about $130 for one night I was pretty happy I got a nice deal for a hotel located close to the Amtrak station and ballpark (which is where I needed to be). When I had originally booked the room, nowhere in the booking did it say that there was an age limit to stay in the room. I'm 19 and was able to the book the room with no problem. Here's where the problem started. I called the hotel to make sure I wouldn't have an issue staying there due to my age. The first girl told me the age limit is 18 and that I would have no problem. I asked her if she could double confirm with me (aka ask someone else as well) and she directed my call to a different person. This person didn't know and assumed it was 18. I called the next day and another person proceeded to tell me that the age limit was 21 and that I would have to cancel my reservation. Keep in mind, this was a week before my staying and I had nowhere else to stay. I told her my situation and she said. I finally was able to speak with an supervisor who was very kind and told me that it was 21 years of age but if I was quiet and respected the rules of the hotel then they would let it slide for one night (this was after she spoke to the general manager of the hotel). She was very helpful about it and she felt bad that no one else could give me a correct answer/were uninformed of the age limit. 

After all of that was squared away, the actual checking in and hotel experience was fantastic! I got a free cookie by the front desk before I went to my room. My room looked like it had been recently remodeled and has a nice view over the pool. I really like how they restored the train station in a hotel. How awesome is that?-- preserving history and restoring it. I also really like it's proximity to downtown and the character of the hotel. Hopefully I can stay here again if I ever find myself in St. Louis.

<|endoftext|>I decided I had to do the touristy thing and stop at the St. Louis Gateway Arch when I was road tripping to KCMO. About a week prior to my trip, I pricelined a hotel for downtown St. Louis and found this hotel for a steal! I didn't arrive to the hotel til past 9pm so I didn't really get to check out the surroundings too much. Someone else said that the area seemed a bit dicey...it just seemed desolate to me. I wouldn't consider it dicey, but then again, I hang out in Detroit all the time, so dicey takes on a whole new meaning to me. 

The hotel itself was beautiful. Built in a historical train station, it still retains its original structure and features of a larger station. The staff was super nice and hospitable. My room which overlooked the indoor mall was pretty much your normal Marriott room...nice king sized bed, clean room and bathroom. Parking was very close by and at a decent rate. Overall, I was pretty happy with the hotel and its location as it was easy for me to grab the MetroLink train to the Arch so I could do my tourist thing in the am. I would definitely return if I'm in the area again.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>square peg definitely has yelp to thank for the $200+ i dropped there yesterday (not all on presents for me, sheesh!). until a few days ago, i had never heard of the shop but i saw them mentioned in the most recent weekly yelp round-up. i was instantly intrigued and a bit...embarrassed maybe (rueful? regretful?)? as a kid growing up in philly i knew all the cool shopping spots, but as i got older (and busier) so much cool shit just doesn't hit my radar....

but thankfully, places like square peg get the attention they deserve. it took be about ten minutes to get past the first six feet of the shop. i wanted to touch (and buy) everything i saw and was barely successful in buying more for those on my shopping list than i was for myself. i am not going to list my specific purchases (since the recipients may read this review), but to give you an idea of what the shop has....leather cuffs, awesome jewelry (including fresh fruit earrings. intrigued? go check em out. :D and cool pendants, buttons and bracelets/necklaces), small crafted keepsakes and magnets, knitted bits of prettiness, pleasantly pungent soy candles (i have never smelled candles this fragrant, in a good way for sure. and yes, the alliteration is a oblique reference to penny pingleton is permanently punished in case you were wondering...), bags/purses, baby onesies and assorted prints....i am sure there are tons of other perfect presents there, and i was able to finish up two people on my list and make headway on a third (and find something a little extra for my sister). i LOVE places like this, perfect for presents and goodies (or when you want to indulge yourself).....thank you yelp for the word.....

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number.

<|endoftext|>square peg definitely has yelp to thank for the $200+ i dropped there yesterday (not all on presents for me, sheesh!). until a few days ago, i had never heard of the shop but i saw them mentioned in the most recent weekly yelp round-up. i was instantly intrigued and a bit...embarrassed maybe (rueful? regretful?)? as a kid growing up in philly i knew all the cool shopping spots, but as i got older (and busier) so much cool shit just doesn't hit my radar....

but thankfully, places like square peg get the attention they deserve. it took be about ten minutes to get past the first six feet of the shop. i wanted to touch (and buy) everything i saw and was barely successful in buying more for those on my shopping list than i was for myself. i am not going to list my specific purchases (since the recipients may read this review), but to give you an idea of what the shop has....leather cuffs, awesome jewelry (including fresh fruit earrings. intrigued? go check em out. :D and cool pendants, buttons and bracelets/necklaces), small crafted keepsakes and magnets, knitted bits of prettiness, pleasantly pungent soy candles (i have never smelled candles this fragrant, in a good way for sure. and yes, the alliteration is a oblique reference to penny pingleton is permanently punished in case you were wondering...), bags/purses, baby onesies and assorted prints....i am sure there are tons of other perfect presents there, and i was able to finish up two people on my list and make headway on a third (and find something a little extra for my sister). i LOVE places like this, perfect for presents and goodies (or when you want to indulge yourself).....thank you yelp for the word.....

<|endoftext|>My friend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in May 2013.  The positives: hotel was clean, staff was extremely professional and friendly, the hotel was very charming and unique, the location was great, and the breakfast was amazing - tons of choices!  Now for the negatives, which aren't many, but I should probably mention... First, the original room that we checked in to smelled of cigarette smoke.  The hotel is a non-smoking hotel, but the guest before us clearly violated the rules.  The front desk promptly changed our room and even provided complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience with the change in rooms.  Second, the hotel is very large and extremely difficult to navigate, especially coming from the self-parking lot.  The last thing you want to have to do after traveling all day is wander around a hotel looking for the guest rooms because there's no signage to direct you anywhere.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>My friend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in May 2013.  The positives: hotel was clean, staff was extremely professional and friendly, the hotel was very charming and unique, the location was great, and the breakfast was amazing - tons of choices!  Now for the negatives, which aren't many, but I should probably mention... First, the original room that we checked in to smelled of cigarette smoke.  The hotel is a non-smoking hotel, but the guest before us clearly violated the rules.  The front desk promptly changed our room and even provided complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience with the change in rooms.  Second, the hotel is very large and extremely difficult to navigate, especially coming from the self-parking lot.  The last thing you want to have to do after traveling all day is wander around a hotel looking for the guest rooms because there's no signage to direct you anywhere.

Even better than that though, there is a LARGE, custom built wooden train layout that your kids can play with for no cost so that they can try before you buy.  the owners are super nice and always have a smile to share with you.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

This hotel is within walking distance of the airport, although it would be a difficult walk since it more or less involves walking in the street. They have a 24hr shuttle van that you can request instead. 

The rooms are not to bad, they are clean enough, the beds are okay as well, and the hotel as a room that they call a fitness room. They also have a pool to relax at after a flight. I found the service to be  good and everyone friendly enough. 

On the downside is the lack of food choices. They have a Denny's, which tastes like every other Denny's. If you are staying here and looking for food, I would recommend walking next door to the Hilton (which is where I will probably stay next time) and eating in one of the restaurants there. 

Also keep in mind, it is across the street from the airport, so expect to hear planes all night, as well as an occasional train that runs along the backside of the hotel.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This is a hidden gem for all kids that love toy trains.  They have just about every imaginable wooden train set and accessory i available for purchase.  Even better than that though, there is a LARGE, custom built wooden train layout that your kids can play with for no cost so that they can try before you buy.  the owners are super nice and always have a smile to share with you.  They frequently have special events for little or no cost.   I know our family really enjoys this unique kids adventure.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>I decided I had to do the touristy thing and stop at the St. Louis Gateway Arch when I was road tripping to KCMO. About a week prior to my trip, I pricelined a hotel for downtown St. Louis and found this hotel for a steal! I didn't arrive to the hotel til past 9pm so I didn't really get to check out the surroundings too much. Someone else said that the area seemed a bit dicey...it just seemed desolate to me. I wouldn't consider it dicey, but then again, I hang out in Detroit all the time, so dicey takes on a whole new meaning to me. 

The hotel itself was beautiful. Built in a historical train station, it still retains its original structure and features of a larger station. The staff was super nice and hospitable. My room which overlooked the indoor mall was pretty much your normal Marriott room...nice king sized bed, clean room and bathroom. Parking was very close by and at a decent rate. Overall, I was pretty happy with the hotel and its location as it was easy for me to grab the MetroLink train to the Arch so I could do my tourist thing in the am. I would definitely return if I'm in the area again.

Once you move past the lobby and into your room things are a little different.  My room was in what they call "the tower." It is part of the original train station structure. 

I was excited at first then I saw the view from my room and I'm basically looking onto the roof of the floor below me.  Not cool.

No wireless internet at all - paid or free.  Have to plug in to pay $12.95 for the internet.  With all the upgrades and modifications why stop short when it comes to wi-fi?  Nope, not cool.

The "mall" that is attached to the building is nothing short of a tourist trap. Also not cool.

If it were not for the fact that I got such a good rate with my company I would have not stayed here past the first night.

Two stars because I got free breakfast because of my Marriott status and because the roof didn't leak.

<|endoftext|>In town for business so I thought I would pick a nice hotel in the downtown area.  An old train station that has been restored and it is a beautiful hotel inside and out.  

Once you move past the lobby and into your room things are a little different.  My room was in what they call "the tower." It is part of the original train station structure. 

I was excited at first then I saw the view from my room and I'm basically looking onto the roof of the floor below me.  Not cool.

No wireless internet at all - paid or free.  Have to plug in to pay $12.95 for the internet.  With all the upgrades and modifications why stop short when it comes to wi-fi?  Nope, not cool.

The "mall" that is attached to the building is nothing short of a tourist trap. Also not cool.

If it were not for the fact that I got such a good rate with my company I would have not stayed here past the first night.

Two stars because I got free breakfast because of my Marriott status and because the roof didn't leak.

<|endoftext|>This hotel is located near the Tampa International airport.  I stayed here last week and have stayed here several times over the past 8 years.  This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  

Bad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. 

Good - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.

In summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

Beautiful food presentation.  Great taste.  Consistently excellent.

Will deliver to your hotel if you stay at the Staybridge Suites (which is best hotel choice in the area by the way)

All of the Outback take away servers were Warm, friendly, kind and professional.  They are always appreciative of your business and take the time to say thank you.  Feels like a family run institution at this Outback location even though it is a chain.

Management is helpless to do anything to restore the internet connection so they will just give you the 1-877 number of their helpless internet service provider who will just reset the wifi router on your floor to no avail.  Lucky for you, the hotel serves better continental breakfast than your Best Western hotel, and unlike other hotel chains, it offers free hot appetizers and alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine every weeknight.

<|endoftext|>This boutique is very cute and quite a steal for the price. They give you water when you check in which is an added bonus. The lobby is very chic and the decor is 5 stars. The room was clean and very nice well worth the price. The best is that they have a free shuttle to take you to all of the local sites. They also have a beautiful resort style pool.  The only cons were the free parking is great but the lot gets crowded which can be difficult to find a spot. Secondly they have a coffee pot in the room but dont offer tea or decaf. Everything thing else makes this a 4 star hotel at a 3 star price.

<|endoftext|>We stayed because of a conference held in the hotel and we won't stay again.  We requested a room with a king size bed and upon checking in we were told that there are none and we would be staying in a double bed room for all four nights of our stay.   We were put in a room right next to the elevator, across from the ice machine with a window view of a wall.  We are staying at the hotel for four nights and we made the reservation directly on the hotel web site - so no discounts.  The hotel charges an $18 resort fee per day (not sure what that is for) and a $22 parking fee.  They charge for transportation to and from the airport $30 each way.  Today I went to buy a pack of gum in the Cascade gift shop and was charged $2.88.  The hotel is about a 25 minute drive into downtown and a $25 cab ride - so if you do stay - you are a captive audience and they will nickel and dime you to death.  And oh - this place is freezing!  They blast the air conditioning - and I froze to death (and I live in Minnesota).  Finally - the water tastes like a swimming pool so you can't really drink it out of the tap.  On the plus side, housekeeping is great, the hotel supplies you with two "complimentary" 16 oz bottles of water (this must be what the $18 resort fee covers) the place is also clean.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and don't stay here if you don't have to.

<|endoftext|>I decided I had to do the touristy thing and stop at the St. Louis Gateway Arch when I was road tripping to KCMO. About a week prior to my trip, I pricelined a hotel for downtown St. Louis and found this hotel for a steal! I didn't arrive to the hotel til past 9pm so I didn't really get to check out the surroundings too much. Someone else said that the area seemed a bit dicey...it just seemed desolate to me. I wouldn't consider it dicey, but then again, I hang out in Detroit all the time, so dicey takes on a whole new meaning to me. 

The hotel itself was beautiful. Built in a historical train station, it still retains its original structure and features of a larger station. The staff was super nice and hospitable. My room which overlooked the indoor mall was pretty much your normal Marriott room...nice king sized bed, clean room and bathroom. Parking was very close by and at a decent rate. Overall, I was pretty happy with the hotel and its location as it was easy for me to grab the MetroLink train to the Arch so I could do my tourist thing in the am. I would definitely return if I'm in the area again.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>I'm a huge fan of Pennhurst, it's in my area and all the kids have been there at least once to check it out. I was also excited when they came out with a public attraction. thinking (finally! i dont have to worry about running from cops!) 

I could go into great detail in my disapointment, but I'll keep it simple. All the locals cherish this place, we really do. It was like a rite of passage as teens in high school to trespass with friends and go on creepy night urban explorations. It was like our little hometown secret. Part of me is sad that Pennhurst is turning into it's own brand, being developed and franchised into something it never was. I personally wish the attraction never opened after I started going to the Halloween attraction. 

First it's kind of sick that they play on the whole mental paitient thing. They market it differently to make the back story deviate from the real deal Pennhurst State School once was. When you're in the Admin Buiding for the Asylum attraction however, the actors are clearly acting as mental paitients. I'm actually really offended by that the more I think of it. Anyway, my personal opinions aside the basics;

Pros:
the setting is real and there is significant history behind it rather then a buliding simply thrown together to make an attraction.
the drive up is creepy! sets the tone
your surroundings are also intriguing
the actors are very theatrical

Cons:
it's really not scary, AT ALL. 
the ghost hunt is a WASTE, dont do it! It's like a building full of other people talking loudly with flashlights everywhere
the tunnels are disgusting, full ofstill water and mud. 
not much to really do as far as concessions 
way OVERPRICED. 
really long waits in the line if you go in October, opening night in September is the best.

I really don't think I'll go again. I see enough of the area as is with my recruiter's office on the property anyway.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>This train station is absolutely adorable! The architecture is classic, and the ceilings are high! 

I don't know why this place has some terrible ratings from other reviewers. They offer ample seating for you to wait for your train, and there are plenty of food options here. Granted it's nothing too exciting, but what do you expect? There's a Wendy's, Jersey Mike's, Auntie Anne's, a few coffee shops/cafes, and other small name food places. They also have the cutest little flower stand at one end of the station. 

I docked off one star because the employees here don't seem to love their job, but I don't think I've ever met a train station employee who was excited to be working. Although they aren't the happiest, they are helpful if you have questions. 

Getting in line for your train can be a little hectic if you are confused about the train system, but once you get used to it, you'll realize this place is a gem to be at and take in!

<|endoftext|>My friend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in May 2013.  The positives: hotel was clean, staff was extremely professional and friendly, the hotel was very charming and unique, the location was great, and the breakfast was amazing - tons of choices!  Now for the negatives, which aren't many, but I should probably mention... First, the original room that we checked in to smelled of cigarette smoke.  The hotel is a non-smoking hotel, but the guest before us clearly violated the rules.  The front desk promptly changed our room and even provided complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience with the change in rooms.  Second, the hotel is very large and extremely difficult to navigate, especially coming from the self-parking lot.  The last thing you want to have to do after traveling all day is wander around a hotel looking for the guest rooms because there's no signage to direct you anywhere.

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>Maybe your best choice for a hotel stay in the Tampa area.  In general I like the boutique hotel branch of the Sheraton family of hotels, but this one has the winning trifecta of location, staff and relative price.  Even when a bowl game is coming up there's a good choice of mid priced hotel options in Tampa (still, of course book as far in advance as you can), if you're anchoring your plans around Raymand James Stadium your best choices are around the airport or downtown.  Having tried both, I think you end up better off downtown so you're closer to other fun stuff to do than being in the airport area.  In the downtown area, there are a number of hotel choices hovering between $100 to $160 a night (depending on how fast you book when they announce the Outback Bowl teams), with Aloft being about midrange.  However, they didn't charge me more for the king size bed, and we didn't experience any of the usual noise problems New Year's Eve (in spite of the party at the bar).  
    The Aloft Tampa Downtown is in a great location, you can take the number 30 HART bus right from the airport (Red Terminal, just outside of the Southwest Airlines baggage claim area) to across the street from this hotel (on the bridge) for only $2.  They don't know about public transportation in the hotel, use Google Maps.  Although Lyft was never more than 5 minutes away from here, for the most part we were able to easily use public transportation, a short and nice walk away is the downtown streetcar terminal which is a fun and cheap way to get to and from the aquarium and Ybor City.  The hotel is right on the Tampa Riverwalk, which is wonderful day, night but especially sunset.  I'm sure the Riverwalk is also nice for sunrise but that's just not in my wheelhouse.  Within two blocks are four good breakfast choices (and one terrible one), a good French restaurant, a CVS, a taco-bus, and just over the bridge is the interesting Plant museum and gardens.  Very close to the University of Tampa (from where Chyna graduated).
   The hotel is very attractive in terms of interior design, the theme is hi-fi audiophile, 1970s mod, it's clean and modern.  The staff is friendly and generally very accommodating, though they aren't that helpful in terms of local information (no hotel workers are nowadays). I found the hallways confusing (round, circular), but I also found the bar friendly and inviting so the two may be connected in some way.  The bartenders are skillful and interesting, there are no hidden up-charges just because you order rocks or neat, there's an adequate selection of good whiskey and they mix an excellent mojito (maybe a local requirement?).  Our room didn't have a great view (mostly the hotel wall next door) but the pool/lounge/sundeck has an excellent view.  That deck is a very nice place to hang out.  There's an excellent work out room that faces the river, marred somewhat by the choice of music (disco-remix) with high quality step, treadmill and exercise-cycle machines.  
    The rooms are very comfortable, nice roomy showers with great ventilation in the bathrooms, lots of electrical outlets, comfortable pillowtop beds, excellent housekeeping staff.  Minor complaint, not enough hooks or places to hang towels and clothes, no drawers for clothes.  The workstation/desk is a little stingy but there are two functional desktop computers for guest use attached to a printer.  WiFi was good, free.  If you're booking for under $100 a night, I'd say this is a 5 star choice.

In the downtown area, there are a number of hotel choices hovering between $100 to $160 a night (depending on how fast you book when they announce the Outback Bowl teams), with Aloft being about midrange.  However, they didn't charge me more for the king size bed, and we didn't experience any of the usual noise problems New Year's Eve (in spite of the party at the bar).  
    The Aloft Tampa Downtown is in a great location, you can take the number 30 HART bus right from the airport (Red Terminal, just outside of the Southwest Airlines baggage claim area) to across the street from this hotel (on the bridge) for only $2.  They don't know about public transportation in the hotel, use Google Maps.  Although Lyft was never more than 5 minutes away from here, for the most part we were able to easily use public transportation, a short and nice walk away is the downtown streetcar terminal which is a fun and cheap way to get to and from the aquarium and Ybor City.  The hotel is right on the Tampa Riverwalk, which is wonderful day, night but especially sunset.  I'm sure the Riverwalk is also nice for sunrise but that's just not in my wheelhouse.  Within two blocks are four good breakfast choices (and one terrible one), a good French restaurant, a CVS, a taco-bus, and just over the bridge is the interesting Plant museum and gardens.  Very close to the University of Tampa (from where Chyna graduated).
   The hotel is very attractive in terms of interior design, the theme is hi-fi audiophile, 1970s mod, it's clean and modern.  The staff is friendly and generally very accommodating, though they aren't that helpful in terms of local information (no hotel workers are nowadays). I found the hallways confusing (round, circular), but I also found the bar friendly and inviting so the two may be connected in some way.  The bartenders are skillful and interesting, there are no hidden up-charges just because you order rocks or neat, there's an adequate selection of good whiskey and they mix an excellent mojito (maybe a local requirement?).  Our room didn't have a great view (mostly the hotel wall next door) but the pool/lounge/sundeck has an excellent view.  That deck is a very nice place to hang out.  There's an excellent work out room that faces the river, marred somewhat by the choice of music (disco-remix) with high quality step, treadmill and exercise-cycle machines.  
    The rooms are very comfortable, nice roomy showers with great ventilation in the bathrooms, lots of electrical outlets, comfortable pillowtop beds, excellent housekeeping staff.  Minor complaint, not enough hooks or places to hang towels and clothes, no drawers for clothes.  The workstation/desk is a little stingy but there are two functional desktop computers for guest use attached to a printer.  WiFi was good, free.  If you're booking for under $100 a night, I'd say this is a 5 star choice.

<|endoftext|>Ted Drewes seems to be a local hangout in St. Louis.  I was in town for a couple of days with friends I knew and they took me to Ted Drewes, claiming it was a "must see" in St. Louis.  It's pretty tasty, but I don't understand why it's the attraction that it is.  Their custard is delicious, but it's rivalled by other ice cream and yogurt places.  Their combinations are delicious though!  If you want to get a taste of St. Louis and great custard, you've got to visit Ted Drewes.

<|endoftext|>I have been to just about every Haunted House on the east coast in the past 25 years so I feel i am very qualified to review these attractions. I will review all that i have been to so look for my reviews everywhere. I plan my OCT each year around haunted Houses. I am very fair in my reviews as well and feel they are accurate. This review is for VALLEY OF FEAR. Since i go to so many houses my expectations were very low for this one. Not much press on it and had not heard to much about it. The lady on the phone told me that the "Actors" were the best part. I must say i agree. The people that work there did a superb job at "being the part" The hay ride was very cool but my biggest complaint for every single attraction here was that they were all just way way way too short. The hayride was about 15 min, and the first zombie house was literally about 6 min in and out. The last one was maybe 10 min. We went as slow as we could and it still under 30 min to go through all 3. Not very many props or animatronics but the couple they had I thought were fairly good. I would say if this attraction continues to grow it could be very good in the coming years but i would not drive more than an hour to go to this place. Pretty fun but not enough to justify a long trip. Look for my other reviews.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>The restaurant just reopened today from a 2 1/2 week renovation. The restaurant over went a complete transition. The look used to be casual dining with a very busy decor to a classy upscale looking restaurant. Don't worry about the prices, the restaurants is affordable. 

Great semi open kitchen so you can view the cooks in action. There is a glass to keep the noise from entering the dining room. 

Apps are around the $10 area and you can get many main course for $14 - $16. 

The food and service is top notch. There are many dishes to choose from. This has now become my wife and I favourite Italian restaurant in this price range.

Great semi open kitchen so you can view the cooks in action. There is a glass to keep the noise from entering the dining room. 

Apps are around the $10 area and you can get many main course for $14 - $16.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>Ok my 4 stars are a little more biased than usual. First off, this hotel IS pet friendly. I mean they don't just accept dogs in the rooms, the staff are very friendly around the animals. Getting to the hotel with GPS was a breeze, but it took a couple seconds to figure out that there is an underground parking garage. It was a little scary and cramped for me and my family at first because we were towing a 4x8 Uhaul, but the hotel found a great parking space for me. The hotel is an older one, but it is decently maintained. The one thing that the Sonesta truly shines in is the food. I called in some room service for dinner and breakfast, and both times blew us away. Now if you're in New Orleans, chances are you wont' be checking out the cuisine of a hotel (Why?!?), but in our case our 3 yr old was sick and we couldn't venture out too much. This hotel had everything we needed, and a great staff to get it to us. All in all I give a solid 4 stars for staff, and service. The room was a bit small, the toilet had too much flush pressure so the water would spray out on every flush even with the lid down, and the thermostat was a little tricky. 4 solid stars though.

<|endoftext|>We stayed because of a conference held in the hotel and we won't stay again.  We requested a room with a king size bed and upon checking in we were told that there are none and we would be staying in a double bed room for all four nights of our stay.   We were put in a room right next to the elevator, across from the ice machine with a window view of a wall.  We are staying at the hotel for four nights and we made the reservation directly on the hotel web site - so no discounts.  The hotel charges an $18 resort fee per day (not sure what that is for) and a $22 parking fee.  They charge for transportation to and from the airport $30 each way.  Today I went to buy a pack of gum in the Cascade gift shop and was charged $2.88.  The hotel is about a 25 minute drive into downtown and a $25 cab ride - so if you do stay - you are a captive audience and they will nickel and dime you to death.  And oh - this place is freezing!  They blast the air conditioning - and I froze to death (and I live in Minnesota).  Finally - the water tastes like a swimming pool so you can't really drink it out of the tap.  On the plus side, housekeeping is great, the hotel supplies you with two "complimentary" 16 oz bottles of water (this must be what the $18 resort fee covers) the place is also clean.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and don't stay here if you don't have to.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

If you tell them ahead of time that you are going to catch a train, you can usually get in and out in about 30 minutes, which is pretty quick in my opinion.  

The hickory burger is my personal favorite, and I would even go so far as to say it is one of the better burgers in town (excluding the gourmet burger places).  If you go during the University City restaurant week, you get a great deal.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>This train station is absolutely adorable! The architecture is classic, and the ceilings are high! 

I don't know why this place has some terrible ratings from other reviewers. They offer ample seating for you to wait for your train, and there are plenty of food options here. Granted it's nothing too exciting, but what do you expect? There's a Wendy's, Jersey Mike's, Auntie Anne's, a few coffee shops/cafes, and other small name food places. They also have the cutest little flower stand at one end of the station. 

I docked off one star because the employees here don't seem to love their job, but I don't think I've ever met a train station employee who was excited to be working. Although they aren't the happiest, they are helpful if you have questions. 

Getting in line for your train can be a little hectic if you are confused about the train system, but once you get used to it, you'll realize this place is a gem to be at and take in!

<|endoftext|>Cheap food and drinks, and everything is really good for bar food.  It's a little off the beaten path, but its a great place to stop if you going to catch a train at 30th street.  If you tell them ahead of time that you are going to catch a train, you can usually get in and out in about 30 minutes, which is pretty quick in my opinion.  

The hickory burger is my personal favorite, and I would even go so far as to say it is one of the better burgers in town (excluding the gourmet burger places).  If you go during the University City restaurant week, you get a great deal.

<|endoftext|>For a suburban Chinese restaurant, Fu Li delivers some pretty good food, at a reasonable price.  Sure it's nothing special when compared to a restaurant in Chinatown, or a 5-star sushi restaurant, but for takeout to eat during a movie, I give it two thumbs up.  My biggest complaint is that when they get crowded (which is once in a blue moon), the service crawls.  Ordinarily there are no more than 2-3 parties in the restaurant at a time, so they're not equipped for a rush.  All in all, it's good for what it is.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>I have been to just about every Haunted House on the east coast in the past 25 years so I feel i am very qualified to review these attractions. I will review all that i have been to so look for my reviews everywhere. I plan my OCT each year around haunted Houses. I am very fair in my reviews as well and feel they are accurate. This review is for VALLEY OF FEAR. Since i go to so many houses my expectations were very low for this one. Not much press on it and had not heard to much about it. The lady on the phone told me that the "Actors" were the best part. I must say i agree. The people that work there did a superb job at "being the part" The hay ride was very cool but my biggest complaint for every single attraction here was that they were all just way way way too short. The hayride was about 15 min, and the first zombie house was literally about 6 min in and out. The last one was maybe 10 min. We went as slow as we could and it still under 30 min to go through all 3. Not very many props or animatronics but the couple they had I thought were fairly good. I would say if this attraction continues to grow it could be very good in the coming years but i would not drive more than an hour to go to this place. Pretty fun but not enough to justify a long trip. Look for my other reviews.

<|endoftext|>This is a must-see attraction in St. Louis!  My family and I took their free tour, which is a walking tour about 45 min long. We got to learn how they make beer, visit the Clydesdales in the stables, sample a Budweiser or Bud Light and at end drink more beer in their Biergarden (including one free 16 oz beer). Soda is free in the Biergarden. I was amazed at the history there and our tour guides were funny and very entertaining. Definitely worth a trip to visit this classic brewery which is a part of our American culture.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>good value for the price because of it's location. Didn't need to take a taxi at all in French Quarter. The hotel is SAFE and the workers are friendly. I'm reading here that people are complaining about smell? Personally  I didn't smell a thing. Our room was nice and clean, good view of the city. 
My only complaint is that we were over charged for our stay and it took them a long time for refund it. If you call their front desk they will send you to five different people who can't help you. MY ADVISE -  just speak to the manager of the hotel or call the holiday inn customer service to get things done quicker. 

Besides that, our accommodations were A - OK nothing special but nothing bad.

<|endoftext|>i can never complain about coming here. i usually have a short wait, as well as great friendly service.  Rob, Rudy, and the service team are always wonderful and accommodating!  
in fact, Rob always remembers me, and has a smile on his face.  out of the thousands of customers who come in for repairs or maintenance, i think its pretty special that they care that much about their customers- now they could be faking recognition but even that shows they go the extra mile. 
fast oil changes, quick fixes for little problems, they always hook me up with a little discount, in fact i even got a tire hole plugged for free once!  the waiting room is a nice place to wait, and they always come in and explain whats wrong with your car prior to letting you hand over an arm and a leg. 

that said, i find myself defending their prices by their fantastic service.  if i minded paying the prices, i would go somewhere else.  but there i am again, 3 months later paying too much for an oil change.  what can i say, i am a sucker for a service station that doesn't feel like they are taking advantage of you. i dont know how to fix cars, so i leave the experts to do their job. 

ps- if its nasty weather, you can get a voucher for a car wash.  you have to ask though!

pps- i bought my certified used honda here, and Lucy was awesome!!!! she helped us leave with a vehicle in our price range, which we love! never was she hard to contact and i didnt feel swindled. score! 

ppps- when signing the paperwork, make sure you get the promised interest rate.  there is so much paperwork, you just keep signing. and i feel that the extended warranty is useless.  we had to refinance right after because we didnt get the promised rate we were told verbally.  that was in the finance department, not our sellers fault.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

Some fancy exhibits is even theme-park grade. Although the price is also the highest, it's well-worth it and my daughter absolutely loved it. The food court inside the museum is a plus so that you can spend more time in the museum without going out for a lunch.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>It's a new boutique hotel located out in the middle of nowhere so both the wireless and wired internet don't work for business travelers located especially on the fourth floor.  Management is helpless to do anything to restore the internet connection so they will just give you the 1-877 number of their helpless internet service provider who will just reset the wifi router on your floor to no avail.  Lucky for you, the hotel serves better continental breakfast than your Best Western hotel, and unlike other hotel chains, it offers free hot appetizers and alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine every weeknight.

The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic".

<|endoftext|>This hotel is convenient to the highway, it is clean and is well appointed for a hotel in this tier level. These points resulted in the two stars.

Now the reasons for only two stars................A) This hotel is poorly constructed. I have never been in a hotel where I can hear every step that the people above me are making. Not stomping or dancing, just walking! In addition to the walking, you can hear other noises originating from above. The surrounding walls appear to be sufficiently insulated / constructed, the issue is clearly with the floors. 
B) This hotel is better suited for families as opposed to business travelers. Given the enormous number of families populating this property and the resulting increase of noise from children running up and down the hallways (I stayed for 3 nights and this was a daily, all night experience), I would not recommend to anyone besides other families. Please note that I have nothing against children as I am also a family man. I must say that while the hotel should not dictate which floor families stay on, parents with numerous small children should be encouraged to stay on the lower levels. 
C) There is absolutely no shopping or dining in walking distance to this hotel. That is not a problem if you have a car but if you don't, be warned.

The positives: hotel was clean, staff was extremely professional and friendly, the hotel was very charming and unique, the location was great, and the breakfast was amazing - tons of choices!  Now for the negatives, which aren't many, but I should probably mention... First, the original room that we checked in to smelled of cigarette smoke.  The hotel is a non-smoking hotel, but the guest before us clearly violated the rules.  The front desk promptly changed our room and even provided complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience with the change in rooms.  Second, the hotel is very large and extremely difficult to navigate, especially coming from the self-parking lot.  The last thing you want to have to do after traveling all day is wander around a hotel looking for the guest rooms because there's no signage to direct you anywhere.

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>BOA has changed the landscape of their facility somewhat recently.  Gone is the ATM drive-up on the east side of the building after a robbery took place there about a year ago.  There are now two ATM's inside of the bank accessible through the southern entrance along with the ATM just off of Park Blvd. near the McDonald's.

I guess they are trying to make the place less of an attraction for robbers, but I don't understand why they do so now and not immediately after the robbery last year that was well publicized on local TV.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>We rented a Hertz car at the airport in Philadelphia on May 22 with a return to the Hertz location ant 30th Street Amtrak Station on May 25.  We paid an extra $10.00 fee for the privilege to drop the car at 30th Street Station.   We had a 12:45 train departure so we arrived with plenty of time to get the car checked in.  After circling the Amtrak Station 3 times looking for the drop off for Hertz we gave up and called Hertz for help.  

The Hertz office we spoke with said that the car needed to be turned in at 2107 Sansom street.  We followed the instructions and wound up in a parking garage with a Hertz kiosk and a garage attendant who did not work for Hertz.  We checked the car in at the kiosk and then enquired as how we were supposed to get the 30 Street Amtrak Station.  Our question was answered by a shrug.  We asked for the phone number for a taxi.  We got a shrug.  Fortunately there was a very nice lady picking up her car and she gave us the number to call for a taxi. 

Fifteen minutes later and $10.00 out of our pockets we finally got to the 30th Street Amtrak Station with about 20 minutes to the departure of our train ( one train a day on the route). A very thoughtful Amtrak Red Cap saw us fumbling and he took us under his wing and carted us baggage and all to our train.

If this experience with Hertz is typical, I am going back to Avis even if they don't give me Delta miles for rentals ( Delta Switched to Hertz). I will be sending Hertz a bill for the Taxi and Red Cap we paid for.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>Ok my 4 stars are a little more biased than usual. First off, this hotel IS pet friendly. I mean they don't just accept dogs in the rooms, the staff are very friendly around the animals. Getting to the hotel with GPS was a breeze, but it took a couple seconds to figure out that there is an underground parking garage. It was a little scary and cramped for me and my family at first because we were towing a 4x8 Uhaul, but the hotel found a great parking space for me. The hotel is an older one, but it is decently maintained. The one thing that the Sonesta truly shines in is the food. I called in some room service for dinner and breakfast, and both times blew us away. Now if you're in New Orleans, chances are you wont' be checking out the cuisine of a hotel (Why?!?), but in our case our 3 yr old was sick and we couldn't venture out too much. This hotel had everything we needed, and a great staff to get it to us. All in all I give a solid 4 stars for staff, and service. The room was a bit small, the toilet had too much flush pressure so the water would spray out on every flush even with the lid down, and the thermostat was a little tricky. 4 solid stars though.

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>Excellent hotel with friendly staff and well appointed (especially for the train enthusiast) and spacious rooms. The hotel is connected to the old train station (rooms are in new wings but hotel amenities are in the restored section) which part of it has been turned into the hotel while the backside is a boardwalk with a couple of restaurants and a spectacular fire and light show (not sure if this is all year round or just during the holidays). In addition to the fire and light show on the backside of the hotel, the grand lobby has an awesome projection show with music that happens several times a day and is projected on the 100 yard long curved ceiling. 

Our package included breakfast which was an excellent buffet with a variety of pastries and fresh fruits, omelet station, fresh waffles and pancakes. The parking was an additional $27 which was a bit steep and is on a surface lot across a non-busy street from the hotel with a 24hr attendant. If you're hilton gold status or higher, they have a lounge that has breakfast in the morning and appetizers in the evening at no cost.    

The location is convenient and it's a really great experience with the different shows that are offered. Additionally the staff was very friendly and helpful.

I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city.

<|endoftext|>We stayed because of a conference held in the hotel and we won't stay again.  We requested a room with a king size bed and upon checking in we were told that there are none and we would be staying in a double bed room for all four nights of our stay.   We were put in a room right next to the elevator, across from the ice machine with a window view of a wall.  We are staying at the hotel for four nights and we made the reservation directly on the hotel web site - so no discounts.  The hotel charges an $18 resort fee per day (not sure what that is for) and a $22 parking fee.  They charge for transportation to and from the airport $30 each way.  Today I went to buy a pack of gum in the Cascade gift shop and was charged $2.88.  The hotel is about a 25 minute drive into downtown and a $25 cab ride - so if you do stay - you are a captive audience and they will nickel and dime you to death.  And oh - this place is freezing!  They blast the air conditioning - and I froze to death (and I live in Minnesota).  Finally - the water tastes like a swimming pool so you can't really drink it out of the tap.  On the plus side, housekeeping is great, the hotel supplies you with two "complimentary" 16 oz bottles of water (this must be what the $18 resort fee covers) the place is also clean.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and don't stay here if you don't have to.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>I think the main attraction for neighborhood goers is the convenience because it definitely it not the food!

I went to eat there with some friends and my snowcrab salad was not fresh!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which I think is the general consensus since they are never busy I worry most of their fish isn't fresh. 

I decided to try it again and ordered to pick-up - and I ordered a rainbow roll and it was THE most unattractive presentation of sushi I have ever seen. VERY SLOPPY!!!!

I officially throw in the towel and give up on Wasabi.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

I found Oakleys Bistro on Yelp and thought I would give it a try.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The service is fantastic and there are a lot of options on the lunch menu.  It was a great environment for a business lunch and very easy to get to (right off of 86th).

I highly recommend coming here for a classy business lunch if you're on the north side of town!

<|endoftext|>If you are looking for something convent to the airport at a reasonable price this is a good choice.  This hotel is within walking distance of the airport, although it would be a difficult walk since it more or less involves walking in the street. They have a 24hr shuttle van that you can request instead. 

The rooms are not to bad, they are clean enough, the beds are okay as well, and the hotel as a room that they call a fitness room. They also have a pool to relax at after a flight. I found the service to be  good and everyone friendly enough. 

On the downside is the lack of food choices. They have a Denny's, which tastes like every other Denny's. If you are staying here and looking for food, I would recommend walking next door to the Hilton (which is where I will probably stay next time) and eating in one of the restaurants there. 

Also keep in mind, it is across the street from the airport, so expect to hear planes all night, as well as an occasional train that runs along the backside of the hotel.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>i can never complain about coming here. i usually have a short wait, as well as great friendly service.  Rob, Rudy, and the service team are always wonderful and accommodating!  
in fact, Rob always remembers me, and has a smile on his face.  out of the thousands of customers who come in for repairs or maintenance, i think its pretty special that they care that much about their customers- now they could be faking recognition but even that shows they go the extra mile. 
fast oil changes, quick fixes for little problems, they always hook me up with a little discount, in fact i even got a tire hole plugged for free once!  the waiting room is a nice place to wait, and they always come in and explain whats wrong with your car prior to letting you hand over an arm and a leg. 

that said, i find myself defending their prices by their fantastic service.  if i minded paying the prices, i would go somewhere else.  but there i am again, 3 months later paying too much for an oil change.  what can i say, i am a sucker for a service station that doesn't feel like they are taking advantage of you. i dont know how to fix cars, so i leave the experts to do their job. 

ps- if its nasty weather, you can get a voucher for a car wash.  you have to ask though!

pps- i bought my certified used honda here, and Lucy was awesome!!!! she helped us leave with a vehicle in our price range, which we love! never was she hard to contact and i didnt feel swindled. score! 

ppps- when signing the paperwork, make sure you get the promised interest rate.  there is so much paperwork, you just keep signing. and i feel that the extended warranty is useless.  we had to refinance right after because we didnt get the promised rate we were told verbally.  that was in the finance department, not our sellers fault.

<|endoftext|>I would stay here again since our room was large and it was in a convenient location.  However, it was a bit dirty, and housekeeping did not refresh any soap, towels, coffee or shampoo unless you called down to request it (which we had to do every day).  Still, they were nice about it, and the hotel has a lot of great conveniences.  Excellent gym if your'e into that.  Overall, it wasn't the best hotel but it was still a pretty good experience.

<|endoftext|>Stayed here for an annual owners meeting for my company in January 2015, the hotel is beautiful and provides all necessary amenities.  Unfortunately the hotel lost power the saturday night we were staying there so no showers or toilets worked in the entire hotel, you would of thought the hotel would of refunded that night but nothing was offered.  I did not have the time to wait in line to discuss the options available to me and later found out that they were offering the option to move to a local partner hotel or recieve a refund.  I was never offered either.

<|endoftext|>I've stayed here countless times when I travel to Nashville for business.  I like how it's not too far from all the action, but still convenient to the downtown area and right near the highway.  I also love visiting the Gulch neighborhood so this location is perfect for that.  The hotel is also usually on the more budget-friendly end of the cost spectrum, which is great. One of my favorite bars is located just behind the hotel so it's a bonus to be able to visit every time I stay there. It's also near some great restaurant options, including the famous Hattie B's hot chicken. Front desk staff are friendly- free cookie bars are usually available during check-in hours in front of the little store area and you get a free GooGoo chocolate bar and Nashville postcard in your room. (Another freebie is bottled Dasani water upon check-in, if you are a Starwood member.) Expensive but convenient valet and self parking- valets are always very fast and friendly, unlike many of the other Nashville hotels. There's also a free shuttle bus that runs regularly between the hotel and downtown locations, and anywhere else you like within the city.  The rooms are standard, but they are clean and fairly spacious...mini-fridge and Keurig coffee maker are available in the room.  The only negative is that the hotel rate doesn't include a free breakfast, but hey, you're in Nashville...head to the Gulch for Biscuit Love! The hotel was recently renovated as well so it's pretty nice and comfortable.  Definitely one of my top choices whenever I stay in Nashville.

Expensive but convenient valet and self parking- valets are always very fast and friendly, unlike many of the other Nashville hotels. There's also a free shuttle bus that runs regularly between the hotel and downtown locations, and anywhere else you like within the city.  The rooms are standard, but they are clean and fairly spacious...mini-fridge and Keurig coffee maker are available in the room.  The only negative is that the hotel rate doesn't include a free breakfast, but hey, you're in Nashville...head to the Gulch for Biscuit Love! The hotel was recently renovated as well so it's pretty nice and comfortable.  Definitely one of my top choices whenever I stay in Nashville.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

<|endoftext|>no way. I don't like for several reasons. Part of what i love about thrift stores (besides the catered-to-my-salary-prices) is the process. You have to work for your finds, and thusly, you feel a sense of accomplishment and connection to those goodies you find in a pile of crap. Retrospect not only takes that away, it also charges you for it. Hugely inflated prices for stuff that I could buy for half (if not less) the price around the corner at aids thrift, or up in my area at second mile. 

Retrospect, i give you two stars (not just one) only because you are a thrift store, and i believe in re-using goods, rather than throwing them out. Maybe you once meant well, but greed has gotten in the way of what i hope was once your larger dream of helping to save the earth one vintage print shirt at a time.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>i can never complain about coming here. i usually have a short wait, as well as great friendly service.  Rob, Rudy, and the service team are always wonderful and accommodating!  
in fact, Rob always remembers me, and has a smile on his face.  out of the thousands of customers who come in for repairs or maintenance, i think its pretty special that they care that much about their customers- now they could be faking recognition but even that shows they go the extra mile. 
fast oil changes, quick fixes for little problems, they always hook me up with a little discount, in fact i even got a tire hole plugged for free once!  the waiting room is a nice place to wait, and they always come in and explain whats wrong with your car prior to letting you hand over an arm and a leg. 

that said, i find myself defending their prices by their fantastic service.  if i minded paying the prices, i would go somewhere else.  but there i am again, 3 months later paying too much for an oil change.  what can i say, i am a sucker for a service station that doesn't feel like they are taking advantage of you. i dont know how to fix cars, so i leave the experts to do their job. 

ps- if its nasty weather, you can get a voucher for a car wash.  you have to ask though!

pps- i bought my certified used honda here, and Lucy was awesome!!!! she helped us leave with a vehicle in our price range, which we love! never was she hard to contact and i didnt feel swindled. score! 

ppps- when signing the paperwork, make sure you get the promised interest rate.  there is so much paperwork, you just keep signing. and i feel that the extended warranty is useless.  we had to refinance right after because we didnt get the promised rate we were told verbally.  that was in the finance department, not our sellers fault.

<|endoftext|>This is a great "off-the-beaten-path" restaurant in Philly. 

I have been to Marrakesh several times and have always been satisfied. The food is good, the price is fair, and the experience is really fun. 

Marrakesh is a Moroccan restaurant that serves the meal in the authentic way. The menu is preset, it is family style, and everyone eats with their hands. The place serves alcohol but also allows you to BYOB with no corkage fee!

The food is all pretty good--- I would say there is nothing that is mind-blowing, but everything is quality. I really appreciated how accommodating they are to people with allergies!

The service is good--servers are nice, knowledgeable and quick.

The atmosphere is cool--feels like you are eating in a Moroccan home! And there is a belly dancer some nights that is a lot of fun.

The price is right and this place is great for groups of 6-10!

Definitely a recommended dining experience.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>This place was the perfect location, the perfect price, and the perfect choice for our stay in New Orleans. If you're looking to stay in the French Quarter and need a place to sleep this is the perfect hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, they had a free breakfast, and the hotel was very well maintained. 

If you're looking for a hotel that your planning on spending a lot of time in you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms were nothing to wright home about and weren't very "romantic". 

If we were to go back to New Orleans we would book Hotel Provincial again.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

Housed in an old mill that has a modern addition, designed and built back in the mid-29th century, that stands today as fresh as when it was built, surrounded by nature, as it is on the banks of the Brandywine river.

Plan to spend the afternoon, they have a great little restaurant there as well.  Take a walk along the Brandywine.  It is just off of Rte 1, west of the 202 interchange, just west of the town of Chadd's Ford.

The 30th Street Train Station has a variety of options for tea and other drinks, but I think this Cosi rates. The service is always good, the staff really is friendly and quick to serve (they realize, I think, that most of us are running for the train and time is of the essence), and they accommodate your desires.  I was able to buy a large sized tea with one tea bag and a little soy on the side. Now that is not something I can do at just any tea or coffee shop.

<|endoftext|>I enjoy a good tea, especially when I am about to get on the train or a plane and know I will be dehydrated for awhile.  The 30th Street Train Station has a variety of options for tea and other drinks, but I think this Cosi rates. The service is always good, the staff really is friendly and quick to serve (they realize, I think, that most of us are running for the train and time is of the essence), and they accommodate your desires.  I was able to buy a large sized tea with one tea bag and a little soy on the side. Now that is not something I can do at just any tea or coffee shop.  

I will continue to use Cosi when I am travelling through the train station!

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>Our family of four stayed two nights at the Palm Pavilion Inn a couple of weeks ago. This was our first stay at this hotel but after reading reviews, we had a good idea what to expect. First of all, this hotel is NOT a resort. It's an older, small, budget friendly, 3 story hotel that has been remodeled in a sort of funky, art-deco style and is an easy walk to the beach. 

Our room was small with two comfortable double beds but well appointed with flat screen tv, mini fridge and excellent wifi. The room is a little tight for four people but would be perfect for two. Coffee in the lobby. Friendly staff. Hotel furnishes beach towels and you can charge the beach chairs to the room. They even had some beach toys for our daughter to borrow.  I was told that for more money, the efficiency rooms are larger. 

We would definitely stay here again but would try out one of the larger rooms. If you're looking to stay at a chain type hotel or resort, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a small, family-owned, well appointed hotel, give Palm Pavilion.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>Anyone who says that this restaurant is "shockingly average" does not know anything about fine dining.  I have eaten in famous restaurants all over the world, and this one is right up there with any of them.  I will admit that if you are looking for a "scene" or a "trendy atmosphere", this restaurant is not for you.  However, having said that, I will say that there is no other restaurant in Philadelphia that produces food that is as interesting, fresh, and delicious as Marc Vetri's.  The service is impeccable, the menu ever-changing, and the preparations fascinatingly nuanced.

I went there tonight for my tenth time.  I took a few friends out for a celebratory dinner.  We ate their famous charcuterie plate, a special preparation of nantucket bay scallops, pig's foot ravioli, pork belly papardelle, spinach gnocci, shoulder of baby goat, salt-cured branzino, a cheese plate, lavender gelato, and chocolate souffle.  We ordered "family style" and enjoyed every single bite.  In fact, we ordered "seconds" of the papardelle and scallops because they were so delicious.

Some advice before dining at this restaurant.  First, eat family style.  It is the best way to taste as much as possible of the diverse menu.  Second, let them help you choose the wine.  The employees of this restaurant are well-versed in the nuances of their wine selections and will help you find a reasonably priced bottle that pairs well with your menu choices and preferences.  Third, when you eat here, "go all out".  That means, get ready to eat a lot, and prepare to enjoy yourself thoroughly.  This is a restaurant tailored for those who enjoy a cozy, comfortable atmosphere, nice people, and good food.  Again, if you are looking for a trendy restaurant, go to Morimoto.  The food won't be NEARLY as good, but you'll find all of the wannabe hipsters you can handle.

I know this is a strong review, but I believe every word of it.  There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Philadelphia that may enjoy more "street cred" (think Le Bec Fin, Morimoto, Buddhakan, etc.), but certainly do not deserve it.  This restaurant is absolutely terrific, and if you walk in with an open mind (and granted, an open wallet), you will absolutely enjoy it as much as I do.

Enjoy.  This will be one of your better dining experiences, anywhere.

<|endoftext|>I attended a wedding there last night it was really nice. i loved the glass door entrances. It makes me wonder how long this place has been in business.  I would say it is on Par with some of the nice private event spaces on Fulton st. Service was top notch this lady Lula constantly cleared our table of half eaten cold food. The Nighttime View of the River cant be Beat!

The bathroom is a lil hard to find and it doesnt have the historical factor like the Cabildo but i would definately book  this space for a private event if there asking price wasnt astronomical.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

It is so laid back and servers so friendly, you don't feel out of place just coming for the pizza (why not, it's good!) but it's equally respectable to be downing shots in the middle of the afternoon.  :)
Good mix, love this place

<|endoftext|>If you are looking for something convent to the airport at a reasonable price this is a good choice.  This hotel is within walking distance of the airport, although it would be a difficult walk since it more or less involves walking in the street. They have a 24hr shuttle van that you can request instead. 

The rooms are not to bad, they are clean enough, the beds are okay as well, and the hotel as a room that they call a fitness room. They also have a pool to relax at after a flight. I found the service to be  good and everyone friendly enough. 

On the downside is the lack of food choices. They have a Denny's, which tastes like every other Denny's. If you are staying here and looking for food, I would recommend walking next door to the Hilton (which is where I will probably stay next time) and eating in one of the restaurants there. 

Also keep in mind, it is across the street from the airport, so expect to hear planes all night, as well as an occasional train that runs along the backside of the hotel.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>It's a popular past-time to evaluate Bridgewater's only in its train station context. This is, of course, fair. But try this on for size... Bridgewater's is the best bar for 10 blocks in either direction on Market, an important street in our fair city. I'd have to really sit down with a map, by they might be the best bar in a 50 square block radius (I know, there's not much in that radius, but still).

I've never had anything but fresh beer (and a good selection), tasty food (it is pub fare, to be fair), and friendly service. The ambiance is good enough--it's kinda like the Epcos center in Disneyworld. There, you know you're in a theme park, but the little country stands are convincing enough that if you want to believe, you can feel like you're on another continent. Bridgewater's is like that... if you want to believe, you don't have to feel like you're in a train station.

They apparently have a rotating menu, so if you fall in love with something there, you better make sure it will still be there next time you come back.  

Even if you don't take the train, this is worth the trip.

There, you know you're in a theme park, but the little country stands are convincing enough that if you want to believe, you can feel like you're on another continent. Bridgewater's is like that... if you want to believe, you don't have to feel like you're in a train station.

They apparently have a rotating menu, so if you fall in love with something there, you better make sure it will still be there next time you come back.  

Even if you don't take the train, this is worth the trip.

<|endoftext|>Update!: It looks like they've made a few changes to the decor.. :) good job folks!.. I'm glad they're working towards an improved interior because the food's really good!

This is my go to indian spot in the northeast.. They have never let me down with the consistency of their food. I've ordered for up to 125 people from this restaurant and didn't see them cut any corners.. They recently came under new management and the food continues to be on point with my expectation. 

Granted they are not my favorite indian restaurant in philly but they come pretty close... Why 4 stars? Because of the decor.. It just needs one final push towards making the seating more comfortable and giving it the look and feel of a classic indian restaurant and bringing it out of the cafe look.. Apart from that.. HIGHLY recommended.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>this restaurant is an icon to santa barbara, i remember when Angie use to greet us and treat all the customers like family, she was awesome the life of Chase.....the food is still excellent the servers are helpful and efficient, but the new owner has no business etiquette or class, he yells at his servers in front of customers and doesnt mingle or make his customers feel like its a family restaurant. Where did this guy come from? Has he ever worked in a restaurant or run one? i dont think so!!! So sad this iconic restaurant is in the hands of such a terrible owner he is running it to the ground, it saddens me and othes who dine there regularly.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

If you tell them ahead of time that you are going to catch a train, you can usually get in and out in about 30 minutes, which is pretty quick in my opinion.  

The hickory burger is my personal favorite, and I would even go so far as to say it is one of the better burgers in town (excluding the gourmet burger places).  If you go during the University City restaurant week, you get a great deal.

<|endoftext|>Cheap food and drinks, and everything is really good for bar food.  It's a little off the beaten path, but its a great place to stop if you going to catch a train at 30th street.  If you tell them ahead of time that you are going to catch a train, you can usually get in and out in about 30 minutes, which is pretty quick in my opinion.  

The hickory burger is my personal favorite, and I would even go so far as to say it is one of the better burgers in town (excluding the gourmet burger places).  If you go during the University City restaurant week, you get a great deal.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

But i feel a bit disappointed in their customer service, i had been calling for a week for their catering services and no one ever called or texted me like they said, they didn't have prices to offer and only one person apparently does their catering quotes. If you offer catering and want to gain profit you should have something set. I ended up having to get a diff person to do it but was looking forward to their tacos. A bit bummed, maybe in the future i might eat there but I'm dissatisfied in my service as a potential client.

<|endoftext|>I have been to just about every Haunted House on the east coast in the past 25 years so I feel i am very qualified to review these attractions. I will review all that i have been to so look for my reviews everywhere. I plan my OCT each year around haunted Houses. I am very fair in my reviews as well and feel they are accurate. This review is for VALLEY OF FEAR. Since i go to so many houses my expectations were very low for this one. Not much press on it and had not heard to much about it. The lady on the phone told me that the "Actors" were the best part. I must say i agree. The people that work there did a superb job at "being the part" The hay ride was very cool but my biggest complaint for every single attraction here was that they were all just way way way too short. The hayride was about 15 min, and the first zombie house was literally about 6 min in and out. The last one was maybe 10 min. We went as slow as we could and it still under 30 min to go through all 3. Not very many props or animatronics but the couple they had I thought were fairly good. I would say if this attraction continues to grow it could be very good in the coming years but i would not drive more than an hour to go to this place. Pretty fun but not enough to justify a long trip. Look for my other reviews.

<|endoftext|>I have been to just about every Haunted House on the east coast in the past 25 years so I feel i am very qualified to review these attractions. I will review all that i have been to so look for my reviews everywhere. I plan my OCT each year around haunted Houses. I am very fair in my reviews as well and feel they are accurate. This review is for VALLEY OF FEAR. Since i go to so many houses my expectations were very low for this one. Not much press on it and had not heard to much about it. The lady on the phone told me that the "Actors" were the best part. I must say i agree. The people that work there did a superb job at "being the part" The hay ride was very cool but my biggest complaint for every single attraction here was that they were all just way way way too short. The hayride was about 15 min, and the first zombie house was literally about 6 min in and out. The last one was maybe 10 min. We went as slow as we could and it still under 30 min to go through all 3. Not very many props or animatronics but the couple they had I thought were fairly good. I would say if this attraction continues to grow it could be very good in the coming years but i would not drive more than an hour to go to this place. Pretty fun but not enough to justify a long trip. Look for my other reviews.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>absolute staple for any wash u student. cheap, easy food on the loop, walking distance from campus. it's one of several related family owned restaurants in the area. always enjoyed everything i tried there in my years in st. louis. the service isn't so great, but i don't really go to any family run asian restaurant expecting the same kind of service you may get elsewhere. my boyfriend (of 3+ years) and i had our first date there...he's mildly addicted to the place and claims it's the only reason he has to go back to visit the city.  for me, it's a pretty standard thai place but i definitely recommend it!

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

At the taxi driver's suggestion, we stopped here for some beignets on the way to the Apple store. I've never had beignets before and I'm SOOO glad this is where I had my first! They're like square doughnuts with a slightly yeastier, chewier texture. Yum-o. I still can't get over the fact that you can get 3 orders (with 3 beignets in each order) for less than $3.

This place is CASH only even though it is located in a mall, but it is affordable enough that the few dollars you can dig up in your wallet is probably sufficient.

There are two pools (we only found the outdoor one, but who cares it was Florida in May and it is muggy - one pool is enough) and a great restaurant downstairs.  The buffets were excellent - kids eat free with paying guests.

They also have a bar and beach area in Clearwater with an hourly shuttle.

There wasn't wifi or internet in the hotel rooms which was strange, but this isn't a hotel catering to business travelers.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>In town for business so I thought I would pick a nice hotel in the downtown area.  An old train station that has been restored and it is a beautiful hotel inside and out.  

Once you move past the lobby and into your room things are a little different.  My room was in what they call "the tower." It is part of the original train station structure. 

I was excited at first then I saw the view from my room and I'm basically looking onto the roof of the floor below me.  Not cool.

No wireless internet at all - paid or free.  Have to plug in to pay $12.95 for the internet.  With all the upgrades and modifications why stop short when it comes to wi-fi?  Nope, not cool.

The "mall" that is attached to the building is nothing short of a tourist trap. Also not cool.

If it were not for the fact that I got such a good rate with my company I would have not stayed here past the first night.

Two stars because I got free breakfast because of my Marriott status and because the roof didn't leak.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

This is my go to indian spot in the northeast.. They have never let me down with the consistency of their food. I've ordered for up to 125 people from this restaurant and didn't see them cut any corners.. They recently came under new management and the food continues to be on point with my expectation. 

Granted they are not my favorite indian restaurant in philly but they come pretty close... Why 4 stars? Because of the decor.. It just needs one final push towards making the seating more comfortable and giving it the look and feel of a classic indian restaurant and bringing it out of the cafe look.. Apart from that.. HIGHLY recommended.

<|endoftext|>i have been here at least 6 times now and tried probably 60-70% of the items on the menu. I love tapas and have been waiting for a good tapas place in Nashville for a long time. My favorite items on the menu are the brussel spriouts, spicy couliflower, steak tacos and fish tacos. 

One of the things i appreciate is that they have tapas portions but also entre sized portions which makes it a great place for lunch as well.

Location of the restaurant and the parking lot behind the restaurant are also very convenient. 

Overall, I really love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for tapas in Nashville.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>I'm a huge fan of Pennhurst, it's in my area and all the kids have been there at least once to check it out. I was also excited when they came out with a public attraction. thinking (finally! i dont have to worry about running from cops!) 

I could go into great detail in my disapointment, but I'll keep it simple. All the locals cherish this place, we really do. It was like a rite of passage as teens in high school to trespass with friends and go on creepy night urban explorations. It was like our little hometown secret. Part of me is sad that Pennhurst is turning into it's own brand, being developed and franchised into something it never was. I personally wish the attraction never opened after I started going to the Halloween attraction. 

First it's kind of sick that they play on the whole mental paitient thing. They market it differently to make the back story deviate from the real deal Pennhurst State School once was. When you're in the Admin Buiding for the Asylum attraction however, the actors are clearly acting as mental paitients. I'm actually really offended by that the more I think of it. Anyway, my personal opinions aside the basics;

Pros:
the setting is real and there is significant history behind it rather then a buliding simply thrown together to make an attraction.
the drive up is creepy! sets the tone
your surroundings are also intriguing
the actors are very theatrical

Cons:
it's really not scary, AT ALL. 
the ghost hunt is a WASTE, dont do it! It's like a building full of other people talking loudly with flashlights everywhere
the tunnels are disgusting, full ofstill water and mud. 
not much to really do as far as concessions 
way OVERPRICED. 
really long waits in the line if you go in October, opening night in September is the best.

I really don't think I'll go again. I see enough of the area as is with my recruiter's office on the property anyway.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>Based on my ride this evening, ZERO Stars, in fact, negative stars!! I got in a red victory cab in downtown philly, and was heading back to where i was staying in Bala Cynwyd. the ride was fine to bala, no chatting or any friendliness, but that's fine with me. then we get to bala and the driver has no idea where on a very long and busy main road the address is and starts to yell at me that I'm supposed to know where I'm going. What??? I'm from out of town and don't know the area, not to mention it's dark out! Isn't the point of a taxi service to make sure you get to your destination?? is this not the way it is in Philly?? SEriously the worst service ever, and I am from the nyc area. FInally he drops me off in the middle of an intersection, all the while yelling that he's going to have an accident on this busy road (I did not design the road!!!) and told me to get out. so, he doesnt want to drive on the road, but he wanted me to get out around number 300 and walk to my destination which is number 19!  seriosuly, he said that- that his only responsibility is to get me to the street and town, then i'm supposed to find the number on foot.???? Then he demanded I pay for the time he was driving around lost, which added about an extra 10-12 bucks on. so there i was at least across from where i needed to be, but broke and pissed off.  I wrote in a formal complaint with the cab number. 
   what i would like to say is that earlier in the day i had called their dispatch and got a cab to come get me, and that driver was very nice. chatted with me and even gave me his card so i could call him for a ride later on. which i sure wish i had! but i noticed the empty cab and figured id get in.

<|endoftext|>This haunted attraction is associated with the Marlborough County corn maze.  The haunted events open at dusk.  They offer a Zombie Safari (paintball), a 3D Barn and Haunted Woods walk-through, and a haunted hayride.  I didn't do the Zombie Safari, but did go through the barn, woods, and hayride.  I highly recommend both the woods and the hayride - especially the woods.  It is scary in a primal sort of way to walk through dark, haunted woods, and they work well with that instinctive level of response throughout.  I don't want to post any spoilers, of course, but I will say that they really work well with sound effects, vision issues and that innate psychological response to create an artfully done, well-acted attraction that is genuinely scary, but very, very fun.

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

<|endoftext|>Okay lets start from the beginning.

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me "Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a "MAJOR" hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a "MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a "MAJOR" hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a "MAJOR" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a "MAJOR" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

<|endoftext|>30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very "movie like" LOL.  

Clean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. 

Plus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. 

P.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!

I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city.

I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city.

<|endoftext|>WOW...This place was amazing. I got the Jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Train Wreck (steak, andouille, salami, fried onions, creole mayo). We also split the cajun fries.  Everything was delicious! amazing flavors.  Jambalaya was packed with chicken, andouille and shrimp. very good!  I was able to grab a couple bites of the train wreck. WOWZA. It was soooo goood! I couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the line stretching around the corner for the Dinics Roast Pork when you could have a train wreck ( i know the dinics is amazing too), this train wreck is prob the best sandwich i have ever eaten in this city. Forget all the gourmet burgers and the cheese steak shops. GET THE TRAIN WRECK. kind of reminded me a bit of a schmitter, but dare i say EVEN BETTER than the schmitter.

this is an absolute must in this city!

All Hail The Train Wreck

fyi you will feel a little train wrecked after eating it! just look at the ingredients you know what you're getting in to! Just go for it.

<|endoftext|>My coworkers and I needed to get a couple Ethernet adapters for their MacBook Airs so we grabbed a taxi to get to this mall. At the taxi driver's suggestion, we stopped here for some beignets on the way to the Apple store. I've never had beignets before and I'm SOOO glad this is where I had my first! They're like square doughnuts with a slightly yeastier, chewier texture. Yum-o. I still can't get over the fact that you can get 3 orders (with 3 beignets in each order) for less than $3.

This place is CASH only even though it is located in a mall, but it is affordable enough that the few dollars you can dig up in your wallet is probably sufficient.

<|endoftext|>i will never take my car to this shop again.  i had a ford focus blow an engine and all points was the first on the AAA list so they came out and towed my car.  

i understand that auto shops do have a certain amount of wait time for a repai; but i waited a week and a half before it was even looked at to assess what needed to be done to fix it.  after that i waited another week and a half before i was informed the possible cost of the repair and was told that it would cost more than the worth of the car.  

i know that this is not the businesses fault for the potential cost but it really would have been nice to know that it was a lost cause so that i could have begun looking for a replacement and not continued to pay for a rental car while waiting for my destroyed car to be fixed.

i will never take my car to this shop again and i advise others to do the same.  

they received two stars from me because their tow service does a good job and is very quick with response and pick up time.

<|endoftext|>Just checked in. Pay attention to the pictures. We are big fans of Hyatt Place, especially when traveling with our college age son. However, unlike other Hyatt places we have stayed, there is no privacy between the sofa bed area, the king bed and the bathroom area.  In addition, the shower and toilet room are impossibly small. You can barely open the door and step in the small room. Their is no place to dress in private. 

All of this is not a huge deal if you are traveling alone, but with a spouse and child it does not work at all and is not what we have experienced at other Hyatt Place hotels. When we asked about a true split room we were told this is all they have and that we could pay for two rooms. Looking back at the website you can figure most of this out from the pictures, but the wording is misleading as was the discussion with the front

Bottom line, a good place to stay as a single, but woefully short for more than one and a huge stretch of the term suite.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

<|endoftext|>i LOVE heading to no anchovies for some grub.  true, i don't do it too often, but i have pretty decent reasons for that.

a.  trying to get anywhere near the u of a  in a car is shitty...especially if parking is required...and especially when you are me.  it takes me an average of five minutes to try to parallel park...what does this tell you?

b.  i am in enough shit with the army for being fat without no anchovies adding to my waistline with their greasy, cheesy awesomeness.

c.  i HATE eating out by myself..HATE IT.  so unless someone is going with me, i either run in for takeout or avoid the place...no way am i gonna sit there ALONE.

now, onto the reasons i LOVE this place (i like to end on a happy note).  there are many, but i will cover the main ones.

a.  the pizza is ROCKIN...big, tasty slices with ingredients that i DIG.  i'm not much of a meat eater, so getting their tomato and motzarella...oh, or the greek one, with feta and artichokes...makes this monkey happy.  you fill up  your sodas yourself...i know this sounds silly, but i like places where i can get my own drink for many reasons...i don't get looked at like i'm crazy for getting it without ice and i can mix diet and regular in the perfect amounts.  i am easy to please.

b.  sitting outside by the u of a is a blast.  omg, i love to watch the obnoxiously beautiful people walk around like the own the world...i just sit back and talk shit.  cuz i'm passive agressive like that.

c.  there is something for everyone, it's pre-made (aka FAST) and it's decently priced for how much you get.

moral of the story...check this place out.  totally worth the time...ESPECIALLY if you can talk someone else into driving.

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>I think I was too harsh on City Fitness. I have a one month pass I got in the mail to try it out, and it's growing on me. the biggest downside to me is that it doesn't have the equipment I've come to know and love at the Penn Pottruck gym. if you're really into crossfit style workouts, this isn't really the place for you (unless you join Thrive and work out in their area which looks to have amazing equipment!). there are no bumper plates, and i really wish they would leave an extra barbell permanently in the area next to the leg press machine for deadlifting (there is a trap bar.. but meh). it's a small space, so they can only fit so much in. there's only one set of 12.5 lb dumbbells downstairs for example- which is a popular size with women, so if other women are lifting i usually have to wait. i also noticed today when i was leaving spin class that they do group personal training downstairs in the astroturf area and take it over which is a bit of a bummer because i love using that equipment (trx ropes/kettlebells). i'm not sure how often that happens though.

on the plus side, it's open almost all the time (5 am to 1 am) - this is HUGE for me. i am a mom and being open that early means i can work out and get home in time to have breakfast with my kiddo before work. same goes for being able to book a spot in a class online ahead of time. it's incredibly convenient. the amount of classes offered is also excellent and i like that there are classes offered on the weekends. i've only gone to spinning so far but every time the instructors have been great. the location is fantastic too if you live or work in G-Ho.

<|endoftext|>The restaurant just reopened today from a 2 1/2 week renovation. The restaurant over went a complete transition. The look used to be casual dining with a very busy decor to a classy upscale looking restaurant. Don't worry about the prices, the restaurants is affordable. 

Great semi open kitchen so you can view the cooks in action. There is a glass to keep the noise from entering the dining room. 

Apps are around the $10 area and you can get many main course for $14 - $16. 

The food and service is top notch. There are many dishes to choose from. This has now become my wife and I favourite Italian restaurant in this price range. 

The reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because they spent the money on renovating the restaurant but our bread came in a broken wicker basket. One of our menus was very worn out around the edges. Not a big deal but don't cheap out on the little things.

<|endoftext|>i haven't eaten here yet but this review is based on an incident we had with this restaurant while making a reservation for our anniversary.  we would be traveling from ny to go eat at vetri.  

after my bf made the reservation for this restaurant about a month ago for sept, the restaurant called back twice.  when my bf picked up, he found that the phone call was to inform him that the restaurant is tasting menu only that costs xxx amount of money and if it was ok with him, esp with drinks and everything.  

now i dont know if this is their standard protocol, or if someone made a judgement call of their own, but my bf has a very generic hispanic last name, so that makes me a little suspicious.  we found this phone call to be very rude.  we have both been working in nyc fine dining restaurants for years but  we have never encountered this sort of situation.  it's just so disappointing because ive been a huge fan of chef marc ever since i began cooking, and friends that have worked with chef marc tell me the experience is amazing.  i've been wanting to go to vetri ever since i started cooking and now the phone call leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths before we even have the chance to go there and taste the food.

<|endoftext|>I'm sad at what this restaurant has become.

Living in New Orleans my entire life I have eaten seafood at almost every restaurant in town, I have slowly turned into a food critic. I also grew up fishing at the mouth of the Mississippi and have been enjoying the freshest and tastiest seafood that you will find anywhere. I know what good seafood is.

My family frequented Jack Dempsey's when I was a young boy back in the early 80s and all I remember about the restaurant is the Mac and cheese. A co-worker invited me for lunch recently and the experience was not good. 

The wait staff was not up to par and not very professional. I remember the owner coming to our table to talk about a group of people negatively because of the color of there skin. That was very disturbing. This restaurant is in a prodominately black area of town and a group of 12 black ladies are dining at your restaurant and spending lots of money. Be thankful you have business at all because your seafood is average at best. 

So I ordered boiled shrimp, what a mistake. The owner brought me a crab salad and boiled shrimp, the shrimp smelled terrible. I asked my co-worker to smell just to make sure it wasn't me, and agreed. I will say the crab salad was okay.

I was disappointed with the food. The prices are a little high for the lack of quality service and food quality.
